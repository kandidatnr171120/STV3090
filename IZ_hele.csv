EU leaders also declared their readiness to provide Ukraine with all types of assistance, including political, economic, humanitarian and military, “as much as needed.” In addition, Brussels intends to support the reforms that Ukraine must carry out to become a member of the EU. NATO decided: the alliance announced new arms supplies to Kyiv Do the countries of the bloc have weapons capable of turning the tide, and how do such decisions affect the prospects of the negotiation process? Earlier this day it was reported that EU leaders at the summit in Brussels supported a plan for the accelerated transfer of ammunition to Ukraine , as well as on joint procurement and increasing military production. The transfer must be carried out without compromising the defense capabilities of individual European states. On March 20, EU countries approved a plan to transfer 1 million artillery shells to Ukraine in the next 12 months. As the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, noted, the plan consists of three steps: €1 billion will go towards immediate supplies, €1 billion for joint purchases, and the creation of a commission to sharply increase military production capabilities. On March 14, the Council of the European Union increased by €2.2 billion the volume of the European Peace Fund, from which the European Union allocates funds for weapons. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which the Russian authorities announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of the worsening situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling. Moscow has repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Kyiv. Thus, in mid-January, Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov stated that a new round of supplies of more advanced military equipment to Ukraine could “only delay the whole story.” Share: if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1487768'); } else { document.addEventListener('recommendationRunInit', function() { if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1487768'); } }); }",2023-03-23

"30 December 2023","While the media is speculating whether the first American F-16 fighters arrived in Ukraine from the Netherlands, reserve colonel of the Czech General Staff Zdenek Petrash from the Brno Defense University is confident: if the F-16 had been used by the Ukrainian military with significant results, the public would have known about it , the iROZHLAS portal quotes him as saying. “Important for the rapid deployment of these fighters, this type of equipment, of course, is the preparation of infrastructure, so we can assume that a larger number of pilots, and the preparation of infrastructure, and the supply of these aircraft have been combined, and, most likely , we can say: this type of aircraft has already been used in an operational situation on the Ukrainian front,” the portal quotes Petrash as saying in an article dated December 28. The reserve colonel clarified that in the case of active use of the F-16 by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) with significant tactical or With operational results, information about this would have already reached the media. However, in the current situation, it is impossible to find out this in real time; time must pass. “But in any case, the F-16 fighters themselves, unfortunately, cannot be delivered in the quantities that were discussed. And they cannot cause a radical turn in the development of this conflict,” Petrash emphasized. In his opinion, if the number of F-16s was sufficient, as well as the training of pilots, if there was effective coordination with the ground of units operating on the Ukrainian front, it would be possible It would be possible to say that information about the use of APUs of this type of equipment could be of some importance. Finger to the sky: what will the transfer of F-16 fighters to Ukraine lead to? Kyiv may receive the first batch of aircraft before the New Year. On December 27, Newsweek magazine, citing an American source, reported that Ukraine, most likely, has already received the first F-16 fighters from the West.

"28 February 2023","The United States of America has retained samples of the BZ chemical agent, the complete destruction of which was announced more than 30 years ago. This was announced by the head of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Troops (RCBZ) of the Armed Forces (AF) of the Russian Federation, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, on Tuesday, February 28, at a briefing about the West’s preparation of provocations using chemicals in Ukraine. It becomes clear: those involved in the work of biological laboratories in Ukraine have been identified Which foreign experts do Russian politicians want to involve in the investigation? According to him, back in 1990, Washington reported the disposal of about 50 tons of the BZ substance, but the United States left its samples. “Currently the possibility of synthesizing BZ precursors has been retained on the basis of pharmaceutical production facilities in volumes of up to several tens of tons per year,” Kirillov said. Earlier, on February 10, US Deputy Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins said that the United States in the spring of this year intend to complete the process of destroying all their chemical weapons. Back in February last year, the press service of the President of the Russian Federation published the text of a joint statement of Russia and China on international relations, which stated that the United States, as the only state party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, has not completed process of destruction of chemical weapons, it is necessary to accelerate the destruction of their stockpiles of chemical weapons. The parties also emphasized that the international community is concerned about the domestic and foreign military-biological activities of the United States and its allies. After this, throughout 2022, Moscow repeatedly called for an investigation into the military-biological activities of the United States. In March 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defense spoke about the existence of a network of biological laboratories in Ukraine working under the Pentagon program. According to the department, American scientists tested potentially dangerous biological drugs on patients in a Kharkov psychiatric hospital from 2019 to 2021. In early November, it became known that the UN Security Council did not approve the Russian resolution on an investigation into US biological laboratories, which was voted for by Russia and China. The United States, Great Britain and France were opposed. Later, on January 30 of this year, the head of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Troops (RKhBZ) of the Russian Armed Forces, Igor Kirillov, said that American authorities have been studying ways of transmitting COVID-19 from animals to humans since 2015 , as well as the pathogenic properties of the coronavirus pathogen. On the same day, the head of the RCBZ Troops reported on US experiments related to HIV infection, which also took place on the territory of Ukraine. The next day, the coordinator of strategic communications at the US National Security Council, John Kirby, admitted that the Americans had indeed conducted a number of studies with Ukrainian colleagues in in the sphere of “pandemic prevention” on the territory of Ukraine. On February 6 of this year, Vice-Speaker of the Federation Council Konstantin Kosachev said that throughout the world much attention has been paid to US biological research in Ukraine and it is only growing due to Russia’s ongoing work on this issue. According to Kosachev, due to the widespread media coverage, it will be simply impossible for the United States to hide the truth about the purpose of its biological research.

"September 8 2023","Ukraine will suffer great losses and collapse as a state as a result of the current conflict. This forecast was made on September 8 by the former head of Czech military intelligence, General Andor Sandor, noting that Russia will ultimately continue to remain a unifying link for Central and Eastern Europe. “The conflict in Ukraine will end with it falling apart, suffering heavy losses and collapsing. Another frozen conflict will arise in the world, which will create many problems for the part of Europe in which we live,” he said in an interview with the Polish newspaper Mysl Polska. Sandor also commented on statements by Western leaders that a total war with Russia is not included in their interests. He noted that the situation in Ukraine remains at a stage where the threat of gradually drawing more states into the conflict is still great. “Throughout history, we have seen conflicts in which no country wanted to intervene, but ultimately did so. I’m afraid we will be drawn more and more into this conflict,” he believes. An unexpected guest: why did Blinken come to Ukraine for the fourth time? And is the United States interested in starting peace negotiations between Moscow and Kiev? At the end of May, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said that the collapse of Ukraine due to defeat in the military confrontation is inevitable. In his opinion, Ukraine will either slowly lose the remaining elements of state sovereignty or will disintegrate instantly. On August 23, Medvedev once again announced the possible disappearance of Ukraine from the political map of the world as a result of the current conflict. He cited the example of Georgia’s invasion of South Ossetia, which occurred 15 years ago, and noted that the current situation in Ukraine “will end in the inglorious defeat of Kyiv, as in its time - the Georgian aggressors.” On July 13, US political scientist John Mearsheimer predicted that Ukraine after Russia's victory in the conflict, it will lose half of its territories. Mearsheimer believes that after Ukraine loses, it will not find a place in the European Union and NATO, because the country will not be able to fulfill the conditions for joining either organization. Ukraine will also not have the capabilities to conduct military operations to return lost lands, he believes. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues.

According to the authors of the material, Truss arrived in Washington to convince Republicans opposed to any funding for Ukraine. “A pitched battle is expected next week with a possible Senate vote on Biden's $106 billion aid package, of which $61.4 billion is earmarked for Ukraine. Senior diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic hope that Truss can help break the impasse,” the publication said. At the same time, according to Politico, the former British prime minister’s delegation does not have a meeting scheduled with former US President Donald Trump, who belongs to the Republican Party.

Austin Chondrosis: The United States and Germany are reconsidering assistance to Ukraine Who might benefit from a truce in 2024 Earlier, on November 29, American political scientist Malek Dudakov expressed the opinion that the US Congress will not be able to agree on the allocation of assistance to Kyiv before the end of the year. The Americanist noted that in the next month and a half, the scale of aid allocated to Kyiv will be greatly reduced. Earlier, serious disagreements arose in the US Congress on the issue of financing Ukraine. A significant number of Republicans advocate stopping spending money on a foreign country when there are a lot of unresolved problems in their own country.

As part of his visit, Austin also announced a new package of military assistance to Ukraine worth $100 million, which included ammunition for artillery and air defense systems and anti-tank weapons, the Zvezda TV channel reported.

He stated this on June 3 during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore. According to Subianto, first the parties must cease fire. “Secondly, each side moves 15 km from its current positions to create a new demilitarized zone,” he continued. Next, international peacekeepers must be promptly deployed in the demilitarized zone. Indonesia is ready to participate in all these processes, including sending its military as part of the UN peacekeeping mission, Subianto concluded. Two steps back: how the rhetoric about the Ukrainian crisis is changing in the United States American political elites have different views on the future of the conflict The day before, the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov noted that Russia does not see the prerequisites for moving to dialogue on the conflict, since Western countries do not accept taking into account the goals of the Russian Federation.

"February 2024","Moscow will never agree to scenarios that involve the confiscation of Russian frozen assets. This opinion was expressed on February 3 by the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Grigory Karasin. “Russia will react to this as an act of international banditry. Absolutely blatant, violating all international rules, including banking rules. This absolutely does not correspond to any moral and professional criteria of the whole matter,” he said in an interview with Lenta.ru. Karasin also said that Russia is drawing conclusions consistent with the steps of the West. Earlier that day it was reported that Belgium had offered the G7 countries » (G7) use frozen assets of the Russian Federation as collateral for issuing debt for financial assistance to Ukraine. Prior to this, Belgian Prime Minister Alexandre De Cros made similar statements. On February 2, the Russian Foreign Ministry called the transfer of income from Russian assets to Ukraine “banal theft.” In addition, the official representative of the department, Maria Zakharova, noted that the next generations of Ukrainians will have to return the €33 billion that will be provided to Kyiv in the form of loans.

The department also regarded such steps by the West as “a blatant encroachment on sovereign real estate.” A day earlier, on January 27, Russian Ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov said that US plans to confiscate Russian assets are not only illegal, but also directed against common sense. In his opinion, Washington has driven bilateral relations between Russia and the United States into a dead end with such measures. However, some EU countries, including Germany and France, are concerned about the possible response of the Russian Federation if its assets are used to help Ukraine, Politico reported on January 24. At the same time, Belgium insists on confiscation, because in this case Brussels will receive hundreds of millions of euros in the form of corporate taxes from the assets of the international depository Euroclear, where Moscow's money is stored. But, according to experts, unjustified enrichment of the state will be illegal. Western countries have tightened sanctions pressure on Russia in connection with the special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to start it was announced on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened. Soon the European Union approved a decision to freeze the assets of the Central Bank.

Yuriy Ignat, adviser to the command of the Air Force of Ukraine, said this on Wednesday, March 22. “Criminal cases may be opened in the near future, because some Telegram channels transmit information in real time about the movement of UAVs or missiles,” he said on air at the Ukrainian telethon. According to him, screenshots of the Virage Tablet system, a Ukrainian program that allows you to monitor the situation in the airspace, are also being published. The screen displays the time and location of drones, as well as their disappearance from radar. In addition, there is data about places not covered by Ukrainian radars. “How they are obtained is a separate conversation. But I think everyone should understand that all this leads to the fact that the enemy knows where our weak points are,” the military man said. He added that materials about the facts of such publications have already been transferred to the relevant authorities.

"February 2024","Ukraine, if the United States refuses to continue to provide it with financial assistance, will likely have to make uncomfortable decisions and accept the terms of a Russian peace settlement, although Kyiv now says it does not agree with such an agreement. The New York Times newspaper reported this on February 6. The media notes that the Russian side may agree to a peace agreement on the outcome of the conflict, which will force Ukraine to recognize for the Russian Federation the territories that have now been occupied by the Russian military, and will also force the country to remain neutral, which will slow down its integration with Europe. “Ukrainians call such a deal a capitulation. But without additional American help, they may be forced to accept it,” the article states. At the same time, the NYT considers it unlikely that Kyiv will be able to return the desired territories by military means, and adds that the situation for Ukraine has become “grim.” Therefore, only Washington determines the terms of the settlement for Kyiv.

Biden noted that Ukraine is in a desperate situation due to the cessation of US military assistance and demanded that Congress “immediately” put a bill on aid to Ukraine and border security on his desk for signature, adding that “the clock is ticking” and Kiev is getting more weapons less and less. The bill in question was presented by the US Senate on February 4. According to the text of the document, $60 billion is planned to be allocated to the Kyiv regime, $14.1 billion to Israel, and another $20.2 billion to strengthen the border with Mexico due to the serious problem with the high number of illegal migrants. Biden announced his support for the Senate bill and called on Congress to pass it as soon as possible. However, on February 5, members of the US House of Representatives from the Republican Party did not support the Senate bill, considering it a failure. Earlier, on December 24, Ukrainian political scientist Vadim Karasev said that Ukraine and Western countries preparing public opinion for the end of the conflict with Russia. He noted that, as such, the military conflict has already ended, at least at the level of serious military operations on the part of Ukraine. However, the Kyiv authorities and the West are faced with the question of how to get out of it “politically, diplomatically and technically.” The next day, the former commander of the Polish ground forces, General Waldemar Skrzypczak, said that Kyiv would no longer be able to regain control of the territories lost as a result of the conflict. In addition, according to him, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will not be able to carry out a second counter-offensive. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

He noted that the alliance will lay the foundation for reforming Ukraine’s defense institutions and their transfer to standards military bloc. “As I said, this meeting will take place in difficult times. The summit will be an important opportunity to discuss how NATO is meeting these challenges.

"17 December 2023","In the Ukrainian city of Nikolaev, protesters who demanded funding for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) were not allowed into the city council's bomb shelter during an air raid raid. As reported by Ukrayinska Pravda on December 17, the police opened a criminal case. The incident occurred on December 16. The townspeople were outraged by the fact that there was a sign on the City Council about the location of the shelter there, but the building was closed. At some point, a security guard came out to the people and said that the alarm had already ended and closed the door. After the incident, proceedings were started under Part 1 of Art. 135 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine “Leaving in danger.” The article's sanctions provide for up to two years in prison. In addition, in the summer, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed orders to dismiss four heads of Kyiv districts amid scandals with the inadequate condition of the capital's bomb shelters.

"10 June 2023","Scythian gold became Russian property after the reunification of Crimea with the Russian Federation. Chairman of the State Council of the Republic of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov said this on Saturday, June 10, on the Crimea-24 TV channel. “[Scythian gold - Ed.] is a serious value that belongs to us, the Republic of Crimea, and no one else. We rely in these judgments on our status as a republic, which according to the constitution had republican property, regardless of whether we were in Ukraine or part of Russia. Today Crimea is part of Russia, which means it automatically becomes Russian property,” he said. Konstantinov expressed the opinion that the collection may disappear because it will not reach Kyiv from the Netherlands. He believes that if the gold disappears, then no one will be able to find it, just like the Amber Room of the Catherine Palace. The Chairman of the State Council concluded that if the jewelry remained in the Netherlands, then they would have a chance to survive. Scythians and us: will the struggle for the gold of Crimea continue? What does the decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on the transfer of valuables to Ukraine mean for Russia? Earlier, on June 9, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands rejected the cassation appeal of the Crimean museums, which challenged the legality of the transfer to Ukraine of their valuables, which were exported to the Netherlands in 2014 for display at an exhibition at the Allard Pearson Museum. On the same day, official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that the decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on Scythian gold creates a dangerous precedent that will not remain without an adequate reaction from Moscow. Scythian gold refers to exhibits sent in February 2014 to the exhibition “Crimea: Gold and Secrets of the Black Sea” at the Allard Pearson Museum in Amsterdam. In total, more than 2 thousand items were sent to the capital of the Netherlands. However, after the referendum and the entry of Crimea into the Russian Federation, they were never returned to the museums. Thus, in October 2021, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal ruled on the transfer of Scythian gold into the ownership of Ukraine “until the situation stabilizes” on the peninsula. In January 2022, the museums of Crimea sent a cassation appeal against this decision to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands. At the same time, the head of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, emphasized that the museums of Crimea were going to seek justice in the case of Scythian gold. He pointed out that in Crimea they regard this decision as an act of international robbery against museums.

"21 February 2024","Ukrainians who evaded mobilization told how they managed to escape from the country. They shared their stories on February 21 with the German magazine Spiegel. 24-year-old Alexander Boyko was forced to swim across the Tisa River on the border of Ukraine with Romania about two years ago. According to him, he did this because “he just didn’t want to die.” Then a certain taxi driver had to show Alexander the shallow water along which he could cross the river for €1 thousand. Boyko waited for three days in an empty house near the village of Solotvyno in southwestern Ukraine before a man took him to shore early in the morning. However, the driver made a mistake about the place, and Alexander almost drowned. On the other side of the river he was caught by Romanian police and taken to the police station, and after a while he was allowed to leave. Now in Ukraine he faces up to five years in prison. The publication notes that Alexander is not the only one who did this. More than 19 thousand citizens of Ukraine illegally crossed the Ukrainian border. About 8.5 thousand Ukrainians of military age fled across the border with Romania alone. Ukrainian sociologist Vladimir Artyukh from Oxford University believes that the adoption of a new law on mobilization in Ukraine may have the opposite effect. “Many men can hide or leave the country at any cost,” - the material says. 47-year-old Vitaly Shevchuk said that he bought a “white ticket” for $5 thousand and left Ukraine in the spring of 2022. The documents came to him by mail, and at the border with Moldova, Ukrainian officials checked them for 40 minutes, but eventually released them. “I felt like I had escaped from a cage,” he shared. Spiegel notes that the “white ticket” - can still be bought in Telegram channels, but now the price for it is over $7 thousand. Vitaly believes that “real betrayal” lies in “continuing to send people to conflict, knowing that tomorrow they could die.” He doesn't believe Ukraine will win. Mark Kovalenko, in his 20s, fled through Russia because he felt he had ""nothing left to defend at home."" “Next there will be an explosion”: riots against mobilization began in Ukraine. Military commissars were opposed in the Carpathian region and the Dnieper. Earlier, on February 12, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed laws extending martial law and general mobilization until May 13, 2024. In addition, in Ukraine on January 30 a new mobilization project was introduced. It provides for the distribution of electronic summons, which will be sent to a special conscript’s office; all those liable for military service are required to submit one. It also spells out new measures for those who did not appear at the military registration and enlistment office, for example, banning draft dodgers from traveling abroad and blocking their bank cards and driver’s licenses. Martial law in Ukraine has been in effect since February 2022. At the same time, Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization. Later, the Verkhovna Rada repeatedly extended its validity. Most men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country.

The Wall Street Journal wrote about this on September 24. “We have recorded several areas in which they (the Russian army. - Ed.) are adapting,” these are the words of the commander of the US Air Force in Europe, James Hecker, quoted in the article. The publication indicates that the Armed Forces The Russian Federation relocated warehouses beyond the range of the HIMARS MLRS, created an impenetrable line of defense, and also began to actively use UAVs. This, according to the publication, creates major problems for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) and their counter-offensive in Zaporozhye. “For this reason, the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is proceeding extremely slowly,” the material says. The defenses are in order: the UAF are unsuccessfully attacking in the Rabotino area. Russian troops have occupied the heights, and Ukrainian militants are constantly getting caught in the fire bag. Earlier on this day, The Washington Post, citing the Ukrainian commander of the air assault unit, reported large losses of the UAF military equipment near the villages of Rabotino and Verbovoe. The Ukrainian commander admitted that sending German Marder infantry fighting vehicles and American Stryker armored fighting vehicles to this part of the front was costly for the Ukrainian army. Prior to this, on September 17, former US Armed Forces intelligence officer Scott Ritter said that the last reserves of the Ukrainian army were being destroyed by Russian troops near Rabotino. According to the ex-intelligence officer, the Ukrainian command threw all its reserves there, while the Russian army showed that it could defeat them.

Then ex-Assistant Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen Bryan said that Ukraine must find a way to come to an agreement with Russia or it will face an internal uprising. On November 9, it was reported that the United States predicted early negotiations on Ukraine due to pressure on the country’s President Vladimir Zelensky. Responsible Statecraft columnist Ted Snyder said that, in his opinion, in addition to pressure coming from within the Ukrainian leader’s domestic political and military circle, diplomatic pressure also comes from leading international partners, so Ukraine will be forced to negotiate with Russia.

"December 2023","In the European Union (EU), the topic of unworkable anti-Russian sanctions is considered taboo. Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico said this on December 8. “Whether the sanctions that were adopted on a huge scale against Russia work or not work, unfortunately, on the sidelines of the European Council this is a taboo topic,” the politician noted. Fico expressed the opinion that if If anyone tries to raise this topic in the EU or hint about unworkable sanctions, he will immediately be reproached for political incorrectness. “Even though this is true, one should not speak such a truth,” the prime minister summed up. From Fico’s point of view, sanctions have made Russia more independent in those sectors in which it previously relied on others, and at the same time harmed the European Union in general and Slovakia in particular. The Prime Minister also mentioned that Bratislava will not support the next package of sanctions if the nuclear sector is included in it. Farewell to arms: Slovakia changed its mind about supplying military aid to Ukraine After the parliamentary elections in the country, the foreign policy course changed. Earlier, on December 4, Prime Minister Fico, in a conversation with his Ukrainian colleague Denis Shmygal, ruled out arms supplies to Ukraine. At the same time, Fico noted that in a conversation with the Ukrainian prime minister he excluded the supply of weapons from state warehouses and warehouses of the Slovak army.

"14 March 2023","The average level of training of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) has decreased due to a lack of experienced employees and officers. The Washington Post reported this on Monday, March 13, citing sources. “The quality of Ukraine’s military force... has deteriorated due to a year of losses. <…> In this regard, some Ukrainian officials doubt Kyiv’s readiness to launch the long-awaited spring offensive,” the publication notes. At the moment, the formations are replenished mainly from conscripts who have not previously participated in hostilities. The shortage of resources and military equipment also remains a serious problem. However, as the American official noted, the situation on the front line does not reflect the real potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, since Kyiv is preparing troops for a counter-offensive separately and deliberately keeping them from battles, including near Artemovsk (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut ).Ukrainian troops are expected to attempt an offensive in late April or early May. By this time, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will receive another package of military assistance from the West, in addition, militants who are currently training abroad will return to the front. However, even in such conditions the probability of success is not assessed very high. Slow in action: how our artillerymen are smashing the earthen fortifications of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Ukrainian losses in January exceeded 11 thousand militants. Earlier that day, The Wall Street Journal noted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were suffering heavy losses near Artemovsk.

"12 October 2023","The Moldovan authorities, with the support of the United States, are actually preparing for an armed conflict with Russia. This was pointed out by the director of the Tiraspol Institute of Socio-Political Research and Regional Development, Igor Shornikov, on Thursday, October 12. He shared his opinion against the background of the statement made the day before by Moldovan President Maia Sandu about increasing defense spending, as well as that the strategic partnership with the United States will become a key aspect of the republic's national security strategy. At the same time, Sandu called Russia the biggest threat to the republic’s national security. In this regard, the expert noted that Sandu’s main goals have always been to oust the Russian military presence from the region. According to him, this has never been particularly hidden. “But what she is doing now is directly preparing Moldova for an armed conflict with Russia. All this fits into the global strategy of the decrepit hegemon - to increase chaos and instability in order to maintain its control over the world,” Shornikov told RIA Novosti. He pointed out that declaring Russia the main threat to the security of Moldova, as well as the emphasis on strategic partnership with NATO is not just a rejection of the constitutional neutrality of Moldova. This, according to Shornikov, is an attempt to provide a legal basis for military actions against Russian peacekeepers in Transnistria. “If the draft national security strategy of Moldova, which declares Russia an enemy, is approved by parliament, the path to a new conflict on the Dniester will be open,” he noted. , adding that the conflict will not begin immediately. Before this, the expert noted, under the pretext of eliminating Russian threats in Moldova, “a political purge will be carried out,” eliminating any pro-Russian element that could make any statements in the information and public space. If only there was no country: why is Moldova quarreling with Russia? Chisinau is aiming for a complete severance of relations. On October 10, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, noted that on the eve of the general local elections in Moldova scheduled for November 5, the situation in the republic is worsening. She pointed out that the current authorities of the republic are committing “legal chaos”, trying to limit or ban the activities of the opposition party “Shor”. Zakharova pointed out that the West continues to push Moldova into a conflict with Russia at the end of August. She emphasized that Moscow had repeatedly warned Chisinau about the catastrophic consequences of such actions. According to Zakharova, all sensible Moldovan politicians are literally ringing the alarm bell in this regard, but the country’s authorities “continue to stubbornly pull it towards the abyss in which neighboring Ukraine has already found itself.” In the same month, the head of the Transnistrian Institute of Socio-Political Research and Regional development Igor Shornikov noted that Moldova’s desire to sever ties with Russia is reminiscent of the agony of the political regime in Chisinau.

Prior to this, on November 7, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said that Ukrainians were buying candles and preparing “for the worst.” winter in history."" According to the diplomat, Kiev will “turn a blind eye” if they do not receive Taurus missiles, but will receive air defense systems. Earlier, on October 29, the director of the Ukrainian Center for Energy Research, Alexander Kharchenko, noted that Ukraine will soon face fantastic difficulties with the problem of the energy system in the country. According to him, Ukraine’s infrastructure is so outdated that it “falls out on its own without any missiles.” At the same time, he noted that there is no point in counting on outside financial assistance to restore the Ukrainian energy system, since the world has long been focused on “green” energy. As it became known on October 13, the German government, through the German state bank KfW, provided the Ukrainian National Energy Company (NEC) with Ukrenergo grant for €76 million to strengthen the protection of energy facilities.

The day before, the INews publication wrote that in the ranks of the AFU militants in Artemovsk there is a pessimistic attitude and a critical attitude towards the command.

The sovereignty of this country and its statehood “have been trampled and abandoned by the Kyiv regime at the feet of the United States and its allies,” explained the Russian deputy. This is how he responded to the words of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that the Kyiv authorities are unlikely to be able to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the country.

On August 7, CNN learned that the first batch of American Abrams tanks had been officially approved for shipment to Ukraine.

"22 September 2023","Many Republicans in the US Congress will vote against continuing to provide assistance to Kyiv, so it is already “hanging by a thread.” This point of view was expressed by Washington Post foreign policy columnist Josh Rogin on September 22. In his opinion, this situation is due to the fact that Washington is increasingly focusing on the 2024 presidential campaign. And if US President Joe Biden's administration wants to continue to support Kyiv, it will need to make a stronger case about the expected costs and duration of military action. Otherwise, aid to Ukraine becomes “increasingly vulnerable to partisan divisions and culture wars.” “When the next tranche comes up for a vote in Congress, the number of Republicans voting against it will be high,” the author points out in the article. Forcing obedience: why the Western media are “drowning” Zelensky during his visit to the United States Experts spoke about the disagreements between Kyiv and Washington Earlier on September 22, Bloomberg noted that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, speaking in private conversations at the high-level week of the UN General Assembly, was very emotional. According to available information, he suspects that the US President's interest in helping Ukraine has begun to fade. And the leaders of other states are likely following the example of the United States, the media notes. On September 21, Biden, following negotiations with Zelensky at the White House, said that a new package of military assistance to Ukraine from the United States has already been approved. And the Abrams tanks will be transferred to Kyiv next week. At the same time, Axios reported that the President of Ukraine, who is in Washington on an official visit, received a “cold reception” in the US Congress. The authors of the note noted that the day before, American legislators opposed funding for Ukraine in the amount of $24 billion until Kiev provided a report on the spent funds previously allocated by the United States. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to hold it was announced on February 24, 2022 amid the worsening situation in the region.

"19 September 2023","The United States of America is to blame for the fascistization of the Ukrainian population. Political scientist Sergei Markov told Izvestia about this on Tuesday, September 19. “Intensive work is underway to fascisate the Ukrainian public consciousness. This is a war waged by the United States against Ukraine, against Russia. This is a political war of the 21st century. The United States started it by attacking Ukraine without declaring war, overthrowing the president, installing a puppet junta, and establishing a system of terror. And then, with the help of terror, they simply began to forcibly change the identity of the population of Ukraine,” the expert noted. According to the political scientist, Ukrainians and Russians have always been part of the large Russian people, but America managed to turn Kyiv against the Russians. “<...> now the Americans have captured Ukraine , occupied it and, with the help of terror and heavy propaganda, are making a herd of zombie slaves out of Ukrainians and changing their identity,” he said. Markov also added that part of the new Ukrainian identity is the glorification through lies of those who killed Russians. In his opinion, in the history of Ukraine such examples are only “outright scoundrels,” which is why the Kiev regime glorifies the nationalist leader Stepan Bandera. “Bandera and all the others, firstly, are fascists in their personal views. Secondly, they are fascists because they collaborated with Hitler. Ukrainian nationalists, based on their personal views, chose in favor of German fascism and became its allies. They were allies of Nazi Germany for a long time. They were three times fascists: they were fascists in their personal views, fascists in their alliance with Hitler and in their practical actions,” the political scientist noted. “In Ukraine, Nazism in the treatment of Bandera has become the dominant ideology.” Former Prime Minister of the country Mykola Azarov - about denazification and people’s attitude to the special military operation of the Russian Federation He also recalled that Ukrainian nationalists were responsible for many terrible murders of teachers and ordinary civilians during the Second World War , and the words that they fought against Nazi Germany are just fairy tales. Markov noted that Washington today is turning Ukrainians into slaves who are simply set against the Russians. “All this is being done not just to fool its own population, but all this is being done in order to turn the local population into a herd of zombified slaves who will kill the Russians in themselves who will kill Russian neighbors and Russians in Russia,” the political scientist added. Earlier, the historian explained why the Ukrainian authorities are trying to whitewash the reputation of the UPA (“Ukrainian Insurgent Army”, banned in the Russian Federation). In his opinion, the whitewashing of nationalist leader Stepan Bandera is necessary not for the Ukrainians themselves, but for the “Western customer”, in order to create the illusion that Bandera was a man who was trying to integrate Ukraine into the European future. Prior to this, political scientist Alexei Kochetkov accused those who deny Nazism in Ukraine of lying politicians. He stated that over the past nine years, a revanchist, neo-Nazi narrative associated with the revision of the results of World War II has been actively promoted there.

RIA Novosti. According to Szijjártó, Hungary has always pointed out that Europeans have this right when the European Union (EU) decided to support Ukraine.

Journalist Vitaliy Glagola reported this on his Telegram channel on Tuesday, November 28. Presumably, this happened on Dukhnovycha Street, in the city of Mukachevo, Transcarpathian region. In the video provided by the journalist, a man climbed through a damaged grate on the window of the second floor of the shopping center, and then went down, clinging to the bars. As soon as he was on the ground, he started to run, but was followed by a man in military uniform. At this point the video ends. There were no comments from the authorities or TCC representatives on the incident.

Prior to this, on August 1, a member of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Sergei Tsekov told Izvestia that Ukrainians began to understand that they were fighting not for their freedom, but for the interests of other states and individuals. This is how he responded to the words of the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Alexander Pavlyuk, that the problem of evading mobilization has worsened in the country. Martial law in Ukraine has been in effect since February 2022. At the same time, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization.

"March 2024","The conflict between Ukraine and Poland in the trade sphere has brought benefits to Russia, and it did not provoke this crisis. The Politico newspaper reported this on March 6. The publication noted that problems with blocking the passage of Ukrainian transport with grain on the Polish-Ukrainian border emphasized Russia’s position as the world’s leading exporter of cereal crops. Russian agricultural products, according to Politico, move freely throughout Europe: for example, they are imported into Poland across the border with Belarus, and no obstacles are created for carriers there. As Gazeta.Ru adds, Poland itself is among the buyers of products from the Russian agricultural sector, and by this, in fact, blocks and isolates Ukraine, which he calls his ally. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk blamed Russian imports for the losses of Polish farmers and the crisis at the border, but Politico noted that there is nothing to prove his words. The publication recalled that in January Latvia tried to achieve a ban on the import of agricultural products from the Russian Federation throughout the European Union (EU), but failed because other states, such as Spain and Italy, were not ready to impose such an embargo because they are large buyers of Russian grain and cannot refuse it. Politico also emphasizes that Russian food is not subject to Western sanctions that prohibit the purchase and import of energy resources and some other goods from the Russian Federation. The border is locked: Poland has threatened to stop the transit of goods from Ukraine According to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, such a measure will be painful for both countries. Earlier, on March 6, Polish Minister of Agriculture Czeslaw Sekierski said that Warsaw and Kyiv are trying to avoid a complete closure of the common border for cargo transportation. There is currently an embargo on wheat, sunflower, corn and rapeseed, but further bans, he said, will harm the Polish economy. Polish farmers regularly block roads in the republic. On March 1, they blocked local highway No. 15 and demanded a meeting with the Prime Minister of their country, Donald Tusk. They added that they are not afraid of the police and do not want to see Deputy Minister of Agriculture Michal Kolodziejczak. Farmers are demanding the introduction of an embargo on the supply of agricultural products from Ukraine and the state’s withdrawal from the EU Green Deal program, which concerns the achievement of carbon neutrality in the alliance countries by 2050. At six checkpoints on the Polish-Ukrainian border on February 27, there were a total of 2, 1 thousand trucks that were stuck due to blocked checkpoints. Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine Alexander Kubrakov said that on February 25, unknown persons poured approximately 160 tons of Ukrainian grain from sealed wagons, which were being transported to the port of Gdansk. He called the incident “impunity and irresponsibility,” recalling that this is the fourth such case. Polish carriers and farmers began blocking automobile checkpoints on the border with Ukraine in early November last year. Among their demands was the introduction of commercial permits for Ukrainian carriers and a limit on the number of Ukrainian heavy trucks entering Poland.

The diplomat added that a signal was conveyed to the new Argentine government about “the importance of strictly following this line in the future.” “Previously, our helicopters were actively used by the Argentines in their Antarctic operations and were highly regarded for their quality and reliability. Now the rotary-wing aircraft are inoperative and require major repairs, but this does not change the essence of the matter: we are categorically against their transfer to Russia’s enemies,” TASS quoted him as saying in his speech at the embassy. Earlier, on December 14, the Noticias Urbanas portal, citing the Argentine Air Force, reported about the country's intention to donate two Mi-171E helicopters manufactured in Russia to Ukraine.

In the article, Kersfeld drew attention to the fact that due to weakening support for Kyiv from Western countries, the Ukrainian leader is currently focused on searching for any possible allies in other regions of the world. He chose the countries of Latin America and, in particular, Argentina.

The location of the event was indicated as a South American country.

This statement was made by Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu in an interview with the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, published on Monday, July 31. “China threatens Taiwan and at the same time talks about peace in Ukraine. The application of such double standards makes China an unreliable participant in the peace negotiations [on Ukraine],” said the Taiwanese diplomat. He noted that Taiwan itself is currently focused on alleged attempts by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to influence the outcome of the upcoming presidential elections in January islands. “We are all committed to defending our country and our democratic way of life,” the foreign secretary said, stressing that the islanders are not asking Britain or other countries to fight for Taiwan, which will rely on its own forces for its defense and security. in the event of an armed conflict involving China. In addition, Joseph Wu argues that democratic forces from around the world will not sit idly by in the event of a forceful attempt by the PRC to reunite with Taiwan. He also added that “all democratic countries must work together” to counter Beijing’s plans to expand its influence and power around the world, including in Africa, Central Asia, and Latin America. “The Chinese government still wants to increase its influence in Pacific region.

The island of Taiwan has been governed by an independent administration since 1949, when the Kuomintang forces, led by General Chiang Kai-shek, who lost the civil war with the Communist Party of China, moved to Taiwan.

He noted that now Kyiv cannot change tax policy, the tools for increasing budget revenues are limited . Any innovations, including excise taxes, will take time. “I’ll be honest, even if we solve all these internal problems, this will not allow us to cover the needs for external financing,” the minister emphasized.

The parliamentarian called it very symbolic. “It is the thousands of cemeteries scattered throughout Ukraine where Ukrainians are buried the military, abandoned to certain death in the name of Western interests, is the main indicator and achievement of the Kyiv regime and their counter-offensive,” RIA Novosti quotes Belik.

After this, at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, he said that the White House had seen “noticeable progress” in the Ukrainian counter-offensive. Blinken also recalled Washington’s support for Kyiv. Western media have repeatedly noted that Kyiv’s allies are dissatisfied with the results of the offensive, which has been going on for four months.

Earlier on the same day, Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen said during a plenary meeting of the bloc's Parliamentary Assembly that the country is working to expand the coalition of countries that are ready to supply these fighters to Ukraine. Frederiksen said war fatigue “will have no place in the transatlantic community” as long as the Ukrainians are willing to fight it.

"March 2024","The European Union (EU) does not yet need to create a unified army, but instead needs to work on cohesion between the military forces of each member country. This was stated by the alliance's High Representative for Foreign Policy and Security, Josep Borrell, as quoted by the Politico newspaper on March 6. “Defense is the competence of member states. The point is not to have an EU army, but to work better together with the 27 armies,” he said. At the same time, Borrell clarified that among the EU countries there was a “sense of urgency and responsibility” to intensify joint work in the field of defense In addition, the newspaper pointed out that for many years Germany, France and Hungary have called on other EU countries to create a unified army, but in recent months this topic has died down amid intense discussions on defense issues. The publication noted that, according to the German MEP Hannah Neumann, the reason for the abandonment of such ideas is the inability of the organization to produce the necessary amount of ammunition to protect the alliance and its allies. Get a spin: The West has turned Ukraine into a weapons testing site How the United States and European countries are making money by prolonging the conflict and the deaths of civilians On the eve of March 5, Borrell said that the EU defense industry does not have enough funding to produce enough weapons to help Ukraine and European needs countries According to him, it is necessary to meet demand. That day, the European Commission (EC) presented the EU defense industry strategy. It included purchasing at least 40% of defense equipment on a joint basis by 2030, increasing the share of trade in this area within the European Union to 35% of the value of the alliance's circulating market also by 2030, and ensuring at least 50% of defense purchases within the organization . The strategy also proposes to include Ukraine in it. As indicated, this implies the development of close ties with Kiev and its full participation in EU initiatives in support of the defense industry. In mid-February, the EU defense industry strategy was announced by EC head Ursula von der Leyen at the Munich Security Conference. She noted that this provides for an increase in military production by 20%. The head of the EC also added that Europeans must “outwit” Russia on the battlefield. Because of the conflict in Ukraine, European countries began to announce plans to increase the pace of their defense industry. Thus, on February 14, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Germany would increase its capacity for the production of artillery shells. He added that Germany will transfer three to four times more artillery shells to Ukraine than in 2023. In addition, on February 13, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called on NATO countries to increase their defense capabilities. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine by against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

According to him, the explosions in the city occurred simultaneously, which indicates that the attack was carried out by the same missile system. He also called reports that the attack was carried out by British-made missiles premature, emphasizing that there was no serious damage from them.

No change of power will occur unless this the West itself will not decide, the journalists of the Turkish newspaper suggested.

Medvedev also added that now the Russian authorities will have to urgently “adjust operational preparations.” At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that, judging by the wording, Kyiv itself considers the previous Maidans to be coups d'etat. Moreover, on November 18, Ukrainian political scientist Kost Bondarenko admitted that a new Maidan could actually happen in Ukraine if the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) fail at the front or the socio-economic situation of the population will worsen.

"August 2023","Conducting any real negotiations to resolve the conflict situation in Ukraine is impossible without the participation of Russia. This was stated on August 5 by the Special Representative of the Brazilian President for International Affairs, Celso Amorim. “As we have repeatedly stated before, any real negotiations must include all parties. If we really want peace, we must include Moscow in this process in one way or another,” he said, speaking via videoconference at an international meeting in Saudi Arabia, as quoted by TASS. He also expressed the opinion that the subject of negotiations should be the issue of a more sustainable security architecture in Europe, emphasizing that it is important to maintain the informal status of the current “exchange of views” without insisting on a formal conclusion.

In turn, Kremlin official representative Dmitry Peskov pointed out that at the moment it is impossible to reach a peaceful resolution of the conflict with the participation of the Kyiv regime. He noted that the goals of the consultation have yet to be fully understood and what the organizers plan to discuss at it. Prior to this, on August 3, the White House said that Washington does not expect that the meeting in Saudi Arabia will bring closer the moment of resolving the crisis in Ukraine. The United States called the consultation another opportunity to enlist the support of the international community.

The Synod of the Belarusian Orthodox Church (BOC) reported this on July 4. “The Synod of the Belarusian Orthodox Church testifies that in the event of the forced eviction of monks from the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, they can find a place for further monastic feat in the monastic monasteries of the Belarusian Orthodox Church. We call on all children of the Belarusian Orthodox Church to intensify their prayers for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and its children,” the message says. The synod noted that they perceive with sorrow the news about the events taking place in the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. There they condemned the actions of the Ukrainian authorities against the UOC, the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, its governor and brethren, clergy and laity. “Despite the protests of tens of thousands of believing citizens and condemnation from the international community, the Ukrainian authorities continue treacherous attacks on the great shrine of all Orthodox believers, without abandoning godless attempts to destroy the cradle of the Orthodox faith of the East Slavic peoples,” the BOC reported. For three sorrows: which shrines of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra can be sent to Europe, the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia warned about the plans of the Ukrainian authorities to remove Christian relics from the country. On July 1, it became known that Kyiv decided to stop the access of the monks of the UOC to the buildings of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. This follows from a letter from the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture, which was published by the Lavra’s lawyer, Archpriest Nikita Chekman. The UOC stated that the demand of the administration of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra reserve to the monks to vacate the buildings on its territory is illegal, since there is no court decision on this issue, and the actions of the Kyiv authorities are already being appealed in court. In 2022, the Ukrainian authorities intensified actions directed against the UOC. They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” Thus, in December 2022, the SBU opened 50 criminal cases against priests of the UOC.

"20 December 2023","Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said that Ankara is ready to revive the Istanbul process to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, may well do this, but this initiative must be sent primarily to Kyiv itself, which blocked this issue on the instructions of Washington. The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, told Izvestia on December 20, noting that the United States approved the “bloody corruption deal.” “If Ankara wants to show some goodwill and stimulate Ukraine’s progress towards the peace process, they may well do so. Any initiative aimed at this goal should only be welcomed,” the diplomat said, answering a question from Izvestia. The only problem is that the Kyiv regime not only blocked the negotiation process, but cemented it in Washington and London out of “fears” that the conflict will come to an end, Zakharova pointed out. “So that, God willing, the escalation stops and it would be necessary to completely stop allocating money and supplying weapons for this bloody massacre. We understand perfectly well that this is a terrible, bloody corruption deal of enormous scale called “the conflict in Ukraine for Washington and London,” noted a representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Trial window: the Russian Federation allows negotiations with Kiev in a Western country Which state besides Hungary could become a mediator between Moscow and Kiev Earlier, on December 18, Erdogan said that Turkey is ready to revive the Istanbul settlement process in Ukraine, which was interrupted. He explained that violence is not a solution to the problem either in Ukraine or in Palestine and the emphasis should be on diplomatic work. Prior to this, on December 8, the Turkish President indicated that the conflict in Ukraine had moved to second place on the agenda after the Gaza Strip, but showed the urgent need for peace. Erdogan added that the world is going through extremely difficult times on a global scale.

"18 October 2023","It will be problematic for US President Joe Biden to ask Congress for aid for Israel and Ukraine amid the rift. American political scientist Malek Dudakov said this in a conversation with Izvestia on October 18. Earlier, Bloomberg reported that President Biden will ask Congress for about $100 billion to help Ukraine and Israel, as well as for the security of American borders. According to Dudakov, you need to understand , that this budget is currently ephemeral, since the US Congress has not yet sorted out the election of the speaker of the House of Representatives. “Plus, the split in the camp of legislators is intensifying. There are also a considerable number of right-wing Republicans who believe that there is no need to allocate money to Ukraine. And at the same time, there is a considerable portion of the left who believe that there is no need to allocate money to Israel. Therefore, agreeing on any tranches against the backdrop of such a split will be very problematic,” the political scientist explained. In addition, as Dudakov noted, the current budget is an attempt by Biden to come to the Middle East, not entirely empty-handed, and show that he has a plan. Crisis control: what goals are the United States pursuing in the Middle East conflict? The White House faces the need to solve a number of difficult problems. Earlier that day, the Pentagon ordered 2 thousand military personnel to be ready to deploy forces in the Middle East in connection with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. However, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said that a final decision on the transfer of forces has not yet been made. On the morning of October 7, the Palestinian Hamas movement subjected Israeli territory to massive rocket fire from the Gaza Strip, and also invaded the border areas in the south of the country. On the same day, Israel began carrying out retaliatory strikes against targets in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians intend to return the borders between the two countries that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967, with a possible exchange of territories. Palestine wants to create its own state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and make East Jerusalem its capital. Israel refuses these terms.

"May 1 2023","The realization of Russia’s invincibility will force the United States to stop supplying weapons to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), Phil Vileyto, coordinator of the “Solidarity Campaign with Odessa” project of the American public organization “Defenders of Freedom, Justice and Equality of Virginia,” said on April 30. In his opinion, Washington is interested in the Ukrainian issue in the context of the confrontation with Russia. “This is not about Ukraine. The point is to weaken Russia as a competitor in the economic sphere, and to make sure that when they turn their attention to China, Russia will not play any role in this situation. The fact is that they also want to provoke a war with China. What will stop them? To be honest, this is the understanding that they cannot win,” the TASS expert quotes. The population of the United States of America, Vaileito pointed out, at some point will begin to question the validity of the American side’s monetary investments in the Ukrainian crisis. They feel at home: a delegation from the United States has arrived in Central Asia again. Washington seeks to set the countries of the region against Moscow and Beijing. A day earlier, American journalist and host of the Redacted News program Clayton Morris noted that Washington is shifting the emphasis of its foreign policy from Ukraine to China. Morris supported his position with an example, recalling the recent exercises conducted by the American side in the Philippines, which simulated a potential clash with the PRC. On April 28, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the United States and allies are implementing a strategic plan to provoke other countries into military confrontation with the Russian Federation and China. . According to the head of the Ministry of Defense, the conflict in Ukraine only confirms the goal of Washington and its allies - provoking other countries to a military confrontation with Moscow and Beijing. Meanwhile, on April 30, the media pointed out the concern of Western countries regarding reports of the unpreparedness of Ukrainian militants for a counter-offensive. It was noted that the readiness of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is causing concern in the United States and other countries that have invested huge amounts of money in military assistance to Kiev. Moreover, the day before, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky confirmed plans for a counter-offensive by Kyiv and expressed confidence that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be able to seize Crimea. He added that the success of the Ukrainian army will largely depend on the supply of Western weapons. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022 against the background of the worsening situation in the region from -for Ukrainian shelling.

According to Zhurova, in this way Brussels intends to provide assistance to Kyiv with other people’s money, since it does not want to do this on its own. “That is, indirectly it turns out that With our money they will provide military assistance and pretend that it is they who are providing this assistance,” Duma TV quoted the deputy as saying for Izvestia. Savings miscalculation: Britain is unlikely to be able to confiscate Russian assets London continues to search for legal mechanisms for this, Moscow promises a mirror response Earlier in the day, Belgian Prime Minister Alexandre de Cros, at a press conference with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, said that the country would transfer €1 to Kyiv .7 billion, which it received in the form of taxes on income from the reinvestment of frozen Russian assets. At the same time, he emphasized that Belgium can only transfer taxes; income from the reinvestment of Russian assets still remains within the competence of the European Union. Meanwhile, back in August, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that Russia’s assets will be unfrozen when it compensates for the damage to Ukraine damage. At the moment, Russian assets in the USA, France, Germany, Italy and the UK remain frozen. This happened against the backdrop of increasing sanctions pressure on the Russian Federation due to the special operation to protect Donbass, which began on February 24, 2022 due to Ukrainian shelling, which led to an aggravation of the situation in the region.

In June, it was reported that more than 1.4 thousand toponyms would be renamed in Ukraine as part of the ongoing “ de-Russification"" of the country. The list of toponyms required for renaming was compiled by philologists and historians from Ukrainian universities. Since 2015, Ukraine has been implementing a decommunization policy within the framework of the law “On the Condemnation of the Communist and Nazi Regimes.” The law involves the renaming of all topographical objects whose names are in any way connected with the Soviet Union or Russia, as well as the demolition of monuments and the dismantling of memorial plaques.

There is nothing new in the text, we have heard it all dozens of times, we will hear it again in different versions,” he told reporters. According to him, no glimmers of common sense are visible in Washington’s policies. Biden spoke in the garden of the Royal Castle in Warsaw on February 21 after negotiations with Polish President Andrzej Duda during his two-day visit.

On the eve of March 1, the editor-in-chief of the Russian TV channel RT Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion of senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge. According to her, the conversation took place on February 19. During it, the military also discussed the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine. A fragment of an audio recording of representatives of the German Air Force said that the officers discussed how many such shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether such a strike would be effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force command Frank Graefe, the Bundeswehr BBC inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte.

"23 May 2023","It will take at least a year and a half to train Ukrainian pilots to operate F-16 fighters. In this regard, there is a high probability that Polish and Canadian military personnel will be involved in the conflict under the guise of Ukrainian ones. Military expert Alexey Leonkov expressed this opinion on Tuesday, May 23. “But we will immediately see ready-made combat pilots, as was the case with other military equipment, which, as it turned out, was controlled by the Poles. It will be the same here: Canadian and Polish pilots will be involved,” he said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. According to the expert, the logic of piloting Soviet aircraft and the F-16 is very different. In a short period of time, a person can be trained to take off, land and fly in a group, but to fight or perform combat missions is impossible. “You need to not only fly, but also correctly use weapons systems, practice combat coordination techniques, and so on. Pilots train for five years on such aircraft,” Leonkov emphasized. He also recalled the shortage of personnel in Ukraine.

On April 5, Deputy Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Christopher Grady called the transfer of F-16 fighters to Ukraine excessively costly and inappropriate. He explained that the $40 billion for the supply of F-16s would be better spent on 155 mm projectiles and GMLRS guided missiles. Polish President Andrzej Duda in mid-March, at a press conference with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, announced his country’s readiness to supply four Soviet combat aircraft to Ukraine development, and in the future - its entire fleet of MiG-29 fighters of the same production: this is 30 aircraft.

"January 2024","Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has lost the support of the majority, and many people have appeared who do not trust him. Therefore, the question arises: try to maintain some kind of integrity or rely on a more active electorate, Ukrainian philosopher and political scientist Sergei Datsyuk said to the YouTube channel “Wild Live” on January 2. The presenter pointed out that the choice outlined by the political scientist will lead to a serious confrontation within the country, with to which Datsyuk agreed, pointing out how important it is to decide what the Ukrainian people want - unity or solidarity. Solidarity, he said, is a voluntary phenomenon, and unity is always forced. “In his recent interview, Zelensky made it clear that he is very angry not at the successes of his enemies, or even because of the lack of success on the battlefield. Zelensky is allegedly irritated by the instability of his allies, but basically he puts emphasis on the detachment of some Ukrainians from the process itself,” said Datsyuk. When the presenter asked what to do with such behavior of society, the political scientist exclaimed that Zelensky himself did all this. He does not build a solidarity economy and does not think about how to build it - it is not surprising that Ukrainians somehow behave differently. “People are not excluded when they are considered the rear, when the entire economy is built on them. And when our rear is the West, so why be surprised that people are not your rear?! He himself built this split - there is a front, there is a rear. There is a split between them, on which corruption and theft flourish. A normal clan society, divided and split,” Datsyuk explained. Self-deception and theft: The West is changing its attitude towards Zelensky The Ukrainian president began to be scolded by the American media On January 3, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera wrote that the Ukrainian population was losing faith in the country's president Vladimir Zelensky due to the unsuccessful counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). Ukrainians are tired of the conflict, and Zelensky’s rating, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, fell to 60%, although at the beginning of the special operation it was 98%. The reason for this is the growing pessimism of the population. Earlier, on January 1, Zelensky asked Ukrainians to decide whether to advocate for holding presidential elections in the country or to launch a counteroffensive on the battlefield again. He stated this in an interview with The Economist magazine. On December 22, the newspaper IL Fatto Quotidiano wrote that Zaluzhny could bypass the current Ukrainian leader in the elections. The publication noted that any decision by the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine irritates Zelensky, but the president cannot remove him from command, since in this case Zaluzhny would be “practically invincible.” Prior to this, on December 6, American political scientist John Varoli shared with Izvestia that the US leadership tired of President Zelensky, who lost in the conflict with Russia, so Washington will soon get rid of him and forget about this conflict by the time of the presidential elections in the country. On August 28, Zelensky announced that he was ready to run for a second term if everything in Ukraine in 2024 elections will still take place. Zelensky was elected head of state in the spring of 2019.

It is noted that the training of Ukrainian special forces takes place at the defense training center in the city of Okehampton in Devon. “The training is carried out at a combat camp in Okehampton, Devon. <…> One senior British military source said the emphasis is on using flexible NATO tactics to help Ukrainian forces “shape the battlefield” before striking,” the material says. It also notes that the formed brigade will presumably be play a key role in the actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces against Crimea. In addition, as the authors of the article indicate, Kyiv plans to use new long-range missiles against Crimea, which will be supplied to it by Great Britain, Germany and the United States, in order to disrupt the supply of Russian troops. “Crimean residents can be sure that the peninsula is under reliable protection” Head of the Republic Sergei Aksenov - about the risks of blockade of the region, the construction of a defensive line and threats from Kiev On July 14, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny gave an interview to the American publication Washington Post (WP) in which he spoke about plans to take over the republic immediately after he has the funds. WP added that the Ukrainian “is not ashamed of his intentions to return Crimea,” although a number of Western officials are afraid of the Russian Federation’s reaction if Ukraine attempts to carry out anything against the peninsula. Earlier in the same month, Chairman of the State Council of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov pointed out Kyiv’s lack of real plans to return the peninsula. He said that the corresponding statements by Ukraine can be regarded as a method of waging ideological struggle. The Kiev authorities have repeatedly stated their intentions to return Crimea to Ukraine. In May, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky made a proposal to create a council on issues of de-occupation and reintegration of the region. According to him, the return of Crimea is the only option for both Ukraine and the whole world. However, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on April 18, the statements of the Kyiv regime about the return of the Crimean peninsula are demagogic. The diplomat recalled the promises of the Ukrainian authorities to destroy the Russian language and Russian culture in the event of the capture of the Russian region. The Republic of Crimea joined Russia in 2014 after a referendum in which most of the inhabitants of the peninsula voted for reunification with the Russian Federation. Kyiv refuses to recognize the results of the vote and considers Crimea its territory.

The expert noted that against the backdrop of the EU task of providing €50 billion in aid to Kyiv, the example of Hungary is very contagious.

Winter is coming, and, according to the experience of the last year of operation, the equipment has already stopped starting.

"22 February 2023","Poland is ready to sacrifice its own statehood for the sake of US approval, and then die ingloriously in Ukraine. The historian, President of the National Roman Dmowski Foundation Przemyslaw Piast wrote about this in an article for Mysl Polska, published on February 20. “If I had to play the role of a fortune teller, I would say that the purpose of [US President Joe Biden’s] visit to Poland is to clap on our backs <...> and force us to get deeper into the conflict. This will probably be called the fulfillment of strategic allied obligations,” Piast said. Warsaw style: what Biden promised during his speech in Poland And how the American president’s tour is connected with the US elections. At the same time, for the Poles it is of secondary importance that Warsaw is perceived by the allies only as a buffer. At the same time, as Piast pointed out, the Polish press continues to treat the United States as an idol. In addition, the historian condemned the foreign policy of Poland, which entered the Ukrainian conflict with one foot, agreeing to form the Volunteer Legion. In his opinion, this will lead to the fact that Russian media will soon be able to interview Polish prisoners. Piasta added that Poland is a pawn in the US political game, but not a single pawn seeks to sacrifice itself like that. Onet reported on February 16 , that in Kyiv they announced the formation of a special unit of Poles, subordinate to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. The group can operate under the name “Polish Volunteer Legion” and perform reconnaissance and sabotage tasks. The Polish Foreign Ministry refused to comment on this information. In addition, last week the former commander of the Polish Ground Forces, ex-Deputy Minister of Defense of the country, General Waldemar Skrzypczak, said that Warsaw should “disarm” and transfer its military weapons from military units to Ukraine, instead of sending Kyiv received worn-out “junk” from warehouses.

Russia launched a special operation on February 24, 2022 to protect Donbass. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravated situation in the region due to increased shelling of Ukrainian troops.

This was reported on the Telegram channel of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 22. The diplomatic department recalled that, according to Article 436-1 of the French Criminal Code, mercenarism is punishable by imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of €75 thousand. At the same time, There are “loopholes” in the law that allow mercenaries and organizations involved in the recruitment of citizens to avoid punishment in some cases. “Firstly, according to French law, the concept of mercenaries does not include those who took part in hostilities (even on paper ) does not receive remuneration that exceeds the salary for the corresponding position in the French armed forces,” the Russian Foreign Ministry explains in a statement. Also, Ukrainians who traveled from France to Ukraine do not fall into this category, even if they served in the Foreign Legion and have French citizenship, since they will be considered “natives of a country participating in an armed conflict.” “In addition, the functions of force support are often delegated to “disposable” PMCs (private military companies. — Ed.), recruiting lower-level employees “on the spot.” A similar scheme is actively used in Ukraine. At the same time, mercenaries from among the former soldiers of the French Foreign Legion - natives of the respective countries - often act as instructors,” the diplomatic department added. Soldiers without luck: two thousand foreign mercenaries are fighting in Ukraine Izvestia has at its disposal an analytical note from the Russian Ministry of Defense on the scale of recruitment and training of militants for the VFU. Earlier that day, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) Denis Pushilin said that Paris is showing hypocrisy when refuses to acknowledge the presence of French mercenaries in Donbass. He noted that information about the participation of mercenaries from France on the side of the armed formations of Ukraine is confirmed, among other things, by intelligence data. At the same time, RIA Novosti reported that since the beginning of the special military operation, more than 300 French mercenaries arrived in Ukraine to participate in hostilities. According to the agency's interlocutor, as of January of this year, there were 50 militants from France in the Northern Military District zone.

"September 2023","Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM) are “useless nonsense” because Ukrainians do not know how to use them, former US Marine intelligence officer, UN weapons inspector in Iraq and columnist Scott Ritter said in an interview with journalist Garland Nixon on his YouTube channel. “Patriot is complete nonsense, that’s the reality. Every installation we gave to the Ukrainians is nonsense, because they have no idea how to use them,” Ritter noted in a conversation on September 6. The former US Marine explained how the Russian military disables Patriot air defense systems, taking advantage of the fact that the Ukrainian the side does not know how to handle such weapons. Since the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) received only basic training in working with air defense systems, the installation there can be turned on and put into automatic control. At the same time, Patriot works thanks to special radars. The Russians hack the system and launch false targets, blowing up air defense radars. This leaves the installation vulnerable to missile attacks, Ritter said. “Patriot systems do not work in Ukraine. The only way to make them function is to give control to an experienced team that is trained in the nuances of working with this anti-aircraft gun,” he concluded. An integrated approach: what air defense systems does Ukraine have and what air defense capabilities do they give Kyiv? At the end of August, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky complained that it was difficult to agree with Western countries on new supplies of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM). He added that Patriot, NASAMS and IRIS-T are the best air defense systems that Ukraine has.

Unfortunately, we have a lot of traitors,” he said. Beskrestnov noted that often employees of the Ukrainian defense industry are ready for money to tell where things are happening and where they are going. Representatives of defense structures told him about this. He gave an example of how at one “manufacturing enterprise” a hangar with finished products was destroyed as a result of a Russian strike.

On the same day, retired Colonel of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) Oleg Starikov said that the target of strikes by the Russian Armed Forces (AF) in Ukraine were warehouses with Western weapons and air defense systems.

Thus, the United States allocated $110.97 billion for military, economic and humanitarian assistance to Kyiv, of which $101.2 billion has already been spent. Last month, the White House asked Congress for an additional $24 billion for Ukraine, including $13 billion for military needs. A wasteful matter: the EU provided Kyiv with military aid worth €20 billion. What results does the continuous pumping of the Ukrainian army with Western weapons produce? Before this, on September 9, The New York Times newspaper reported that US arms baron Mark Morales supplied weapons to Ukraine worth more than $200 million Morales' company Global Ordnance entered into a contract with the Pentagon for the production of ammunition worth more than $1 billion. In addition, the baron entered into a deal for the supply of weapons for Kiev directly with the Ukrainian side.

At the same time, military expert Vasily Dandykin, in an interview with Izvestia, noted that Ukraine will probably not receive the F-16s promised by Western countries in the fall or winter of this year, since it has problems with personnel training. He also noted that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are not yet ready to host such “rather capricious aircraft”, since there is no road structure and other support.

Deputy head of the department Michal Kolodziejczak spoke about this on February 5 in an interview with TVP Info. He expressed bewilderment why Ukrainian vegetable oil should be imported at a zero VAT rate, which is intended for Polish producers. In addition, the deputy minister noted that the Ministry of Agriculture advocates limiting imports, since currently supplies of, for example, frozen raspberries amount to hundreds of tons. According to him, it is necessary to increase the production of these products within the country. Kolodziejczak also commented on the upcoming farmers' strike, supporting their decision. He noted that the border with Ukraine “should be very tightly closed.” In addition, last weekend, the head of the Polish Ministry of Agriculture, Czeslaw Sekierski, revealed excessive exports of Ukrainian food to the country, a message on the department’s website said on February 5. “Excessive imports of agricultural products from Ukraine, which does not meet the production requirements in force in the EU (European Union - Ed.), threatens the competitiveness of Polish agriculture,” he emphasized. Sekierski added that Polish products are being squeezed out of EU markets due to the high export of Ukrainian goods. Just a pitchfork: why farmers protested across Europe Green policy, subsidy cuts and competition with Ukraine are among the main problems of French and German farmers. The day before, Sekierski announced the need to cut off fruit imports from Ukraine in order to increase the profits of Polish farmers. He noted that the protests of Polish farmers and agrarians of other European countries are related to the openness of the EU agricultural policy for agricultural products from Ukraine. At the end of January, Sekierski also noted that the absence of duties for the export of Ukrainian goods should not cause such significant damage to the economies of the EU countries and their agricultural sector. industry. He proposed introducing a protective mechanism that would protect farmers in EU countries. At the same time, on January 31, Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal expressed hope that the European Commission would find a way to lift unilateral bans on the import of Ukrainian products in force in Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. On January 22, the European Commission decided allow countries that border Ukraine to ban at the national level the import of agricultural products from there in order to protect local farmers. Mass protests by farmers are taking place in almost all EU countries. For example, in France, one of the reasons for the start of demonstrations by local farmers in January was the upcoming increase in the cost of diesel fuel. Farmers are also unhappy with the drop in income as a result of increased imports of agricultural products into the country from Ukraine. They are seeking to simplify bureaucratic procedures related to the requirements of the European Union. In protest, farmers are blocking roads. In 2022, the EU allowed Kyiv to supply food to the union countries duty-free, which hit farmers in Hungary, Poland and some other countries.

He said many critics point to the US-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, while arguing that the West is driven by self-interest rather than principle. “The West has shown far more compassion for the victims of the war in Ukraine than for the victims of wars elsewhere yet,” he noted. At the same time, US support for the Saudi-led coalition conflict in Yemen, which has had a devastating impact on the country, is cited as evidence of ambiguity when it comes to caring for civilians. However, the ex-minister does not directly express accusations in the duplicity of Western governments, but gives examples that, in his opinion, demonstrate double standards in their policies. Thus, the former head of the Foreign Ministry notes that the United States’ efforts to protect the rule of law run counter to their actions. He recalled that the United States has not ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, while condemning China for violating it. In addition, the United States has also not ratified the Rome Statute, although it calls for the prosecution of war crimes in Ukraine. Two steps back: how the rhetoric about the Ukrainian crisis is changing in the United States American political elites have different views on the future of the conflict Miliband noted that the conflict in Ukraine really united the West, but it led to a split in the world. And this divide will only widen unless Western powers change their approach. He also proposed changing the attitude towards the Ukrainian conflict and, instead of opposing democracy and autocracy, talking about the struggle of the “rule of law.” According to him, this will help attract new members to the coalition. Earlier, on April 15, it became known that Washington would send another $4.9 billion in budget assistance to Kyiv in September. It is noted that these funds will allow the Ukrainian government to provide “essential services to its citizens.” Prior to this, on March 30, the United States announced that it had allocated $400 million to Ukraine for financial and humanitarian assistance in restoring the destroyed energy system. However, in February, the US Republican Party a split has emerged regarding the volume of assistance provided to Kyiv. American experts interviewed by Izvestia said that a growing number of Republicans are dissatisfied with US President Joe Biden's approach to Ukraine: they want to slow down the growing aid to the regime, especially when it comes to new expensive and provocative weapons. The special operation to protect Donbass is about to begin which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

The article did not specify which country sent the air defense missile data. Ustinova noted that Ukraine had hoped to launch the offensive in April, but due to a shortage of weapons, the start date was “pushed back indefinitely.” Raise supplies: will Kyiv receive weapons for a counteroffensive?

About the alleged offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is about to begin in May, on March 15, the American newspaper Politico reported. It was noted that Ukraine is considering two offensive scenarios. Moscow has repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Ukraine. Thus, on January 16, Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov stated that a new round of supplies of more advanced military equipment to Ukraine could “only delay the whole story.” The West has strengthened military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which Russian President Vladimir Putin was announced on February 24, 2022 amid the worsening situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

The target of the strike was achieved, all designated targets were hit, the department noted. Reserves without strength: what was the purpose of the strikes on targets in Ukraine? Russian troops are undermining the ability of the Air Force to conduct active combat operations next year, experts believe.

This was reported by Krzysztof Podgurski, a columnist for the Polish publication Myśl Polska. “The Russian Air Force is hunting Ukrainian radars and positions of anti-aircraft systems, attacking them with Kh-31P and Kh-59 missiles,” the author of the material noted. Podgurski also recalled that the Russian military published video recordings, which demonstrated the destruction of the P-18 Malachite radar station and elements of the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system, writes Gazeta.Ru. The observer clarified that Russian forces are waging an active campaign of tactical bombing of Ukrainian bases fuels and lubricants, as well as points of temporary deployment of Ukrainian troops and ammunition locations. Playing with fire: how the Russian military is destroying NATO equipment All types of tanks supplied to Ukraine turned out to be vulnerable Earlier, on February 27, the InfoBrics portal reported that the Russian military managed to destroy hundreds of units of the latest NATO weapons in Ukraine. It was noted that the Russian army, during the Ukrainian counter-offensive, eliminated hundreds of the best examples of Western equipment, including air defense systems. On that day, Forbes magazine reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) could soon use up the remaining missiles for the Western NASAMS and Patriot air defense systems. The publication also recalled that the Russian military destroyed a NASAMS battery made in Norway in the special operation zone.

"February 2024","On February 1, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Valeriy Zaluzhny listed the main areas on which the country should focus in 2024. “In 2024, we must concentrate our main efforts in three areas. Creation of a system for providing our armed forces with high-tech equipment. Introduction of a new philosophy of training and warfare that takes into account limitations in means and methods of their use. And the development of new combat capabilities in the shortest possible time,” says his article for CNN. As Zaluzhny noted, Ukraine’s goal should be to maximize the accumulation of the latest combat capabilities. According to Zaluzhny, this will allow Kyiv to allocate fewer resources to inflict “maximum damage.” They rushed into uniform: a new stage of mobilization is being prepared in Ukraine. The Rada proposes to conscript women and prisoners, but leave the rich alone. Earlier that day, Zaluzhny expressed the opinion that Ukraine would not be able to increase the strength of the army without “unpopular measures.” At the same time, he did not specify what exact measures Kyiv could take. On January 30, British analyst Alexander Merkouris said that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were no longer conducting offensive actions, the initiative had completely passed to the Russian military. On December 26, Zaluzhny said that in Avdiivka, Ukrainian troops could in two three months to face a repetition of events according to the scenario that occurred in Artemovsk (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut).

"25 August 2023","US President Joe Biden may push Ukraine to resume negotiations with Russia amid the lack of progress of the Ukrainian army. Bloomberg reported on August 25. “President Joe Biden may end up trying to push Ukraine toward negotiations in the absence of significant progress on the battlefield,” the agency writes, citing European officials. Officials say U.S. support for Ukraine remains necessary, since Europe does not have the necessary military potential to provide assistance. It is noted that this could happen in 2024 against the backdrop of the presidential campaign, Gazeta.Ru clarifies. Be silent and listen: Ukraine is dissatisfied with the rhetoric of Western media. In Kyiv, criticism from allies was painfully accepted. On the eve of August 24, American ex-intelligence officer Scott Ritter noted that the reluctance of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky to admit defeat will lead to the complete defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). According to him, the president is pretending that the troops are winning, but the situation in the battle zone suggests the opposite. Earlier, on August 23, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev announced the possible disappearance of Ukraine from the political map of the world as a result of the current conflict. He noted that for the United States and its allies, the territories of the former USSR, which they use to achieve their goals, are “a land of unlearned lessons.” On that day, ex-CIA agent Larry Johnson allowed the overthrow of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky due to refusal to negotiate from the Russian Federation. According to him, because of this position of the leader, the country is experiencing a demographic and humanitarian catastrophe. Prior to this, on August 15, Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that Western countries were pumping billions of dollars into the Kiev regime, thereby further fueling the conflict in Ukraine. He called the situation there an example of “the policy of adding fuel to the fire.” The last round of negotiations between the two sides took place in Istanbul, Turkey on March 29, 2022. They lasted about three hours. That year in October, Ukraine officially refused contacts with Russia. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by the Russian President on February 24, 2022, continues.

"March 2024","scuffle between protesting farmers and the police occurred in Warsaw, the Polish TV channel Polsat reported on March 6. “During the protest in front of the office, a serious incident occurred - the protesters set fire to a “coffin” there, symbolizing the death of a farmer,” the report said. One of the protest participants tried to throw burning “props” through the barrier, behind which stood the police. As a result, a brawl broke out. In addition, as can be seen in the footage, during the action, Polish farmers burned the flag of the European Union. According to the organizers of the protests, up to 150 thousand farmers could gather for the action. Also, a huge number of pieces of agricultural machinery have accumulated at the entrances to Warsaw, making traffic difficult. The border is locked: Poland has threatened to stop the transit of goods from Ukraine. According to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, such a measure will be painful for both countries. Farmer protests have been taking place in Poland for many weeks. They demand that the government introduce an embargo on the supply of agricultural products to Ukraine and the state’s withdrawal from the European Union’s Green Deal program, which concerns the achievement of carbon neutrality in the alliance countries by 2050. In addition, Polish farmers systematically block roads in the country and entrances to checkpoints on border with Ukraine. On March 1, they blocked local highway No. 15 and demanded a meeting with the country's Prime Minister Donald Tusk. On February 27, at six checkpoints on the common border of the two states, they counted 2.1 thousand stuck heavy trucks that could not leave due to the blockages Checkpoint. Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine Alexander Kubrakov said that on February 25, unknown persons poured approximately 160 tons of Ukrainian grain from sealed wagons, which were being transported to the port of Gdansk.

If they pull, they won’t: Serbia does not plan to impose sanctions against Russia Joining EU restrictions could have a negative impact on the economy of the Balkan country “Due to unreliable information about the alleged deliveries of 122-mm Grad missiles from the Krusik company to Ukraine, management reports that sales there were no agreements on this market, and no agreements were concluded on the specified quantities and codification at all,” says the statement, which is quoted by the portal Radio Slobodna Evropa. The statement also states that “the media report is based on the use of incomplete and irrelevant information “, which, as the company emphasized, was placed “in a negative context.” The company added that with such messages someone “knowingly wanted to cause damage to Krushik.” “Not a single one of our missiles or mines has been in Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict contracted without the conviction that the end consumer is not one of the parties to the conflict,” Krusik reported. Earlier this week, messages appeared on a number of Telegram channels about allegedly secret arms deliveries from Serbia to Ukraine. In particular, they talked about the transfer to Kyiv of 3.5 thousand missiles for Grad multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). After this, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that Russia is deeply concerned about media reports about possible supplies of Serbian ammunition to Ukraine and is monitoring development of this topic. At the end of January, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said that Serbia does not supply weapons to Kyiv or Moscow and does not intend to do so. The Serbian leader added that the country's leadership will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Kyiv. He also noted that Serbia is the only country that has not imposed sanctions against the Russian Federation, based on national interests.

"12 February 2024","Those forcibly mobilized into the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) and other weak points and “holes” will become targets for the Russian Armed Forces, which are preparing for a powerful offensive, said Colonel of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) Oleg Starikov in an interview with the YouTube channel “Yes it is.” “They (the Russian army. - Ed.) are accumulating forces for an offensive. They accumulate, they teach. <...> They are really preparing to launch large-scale offensive operations in the area where they find a hole, a weak point. I have already talked about this, where this hole can form, a man-made hole, man-made by our deputies,” he said on air on February 8. Starikov considers the forcibly mobilized contingent to be one of the significant weaknesses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He admits that those who have been fighting at the front for a long time need to be rotated, changed, but not for those who were forced to go to fight by threats. “They forcibly recruited those who do not want to, who are 50+, with chronic and other diseases, who will simply send the company commander . Such situations exist everywhere, where the army is not voluntary, but recruited in this way,” Starikov explained. He assured that with such personnel, any operational-strategic theater will turn into a military failure, because you need to read books about the art of war, and those who staffing the Ukrainian army, “they invent insanity.” “And those who invent this insanity, they can lead to disaster,” he summed up. “Next there will be an explosion”: riots against mobilization began in Ukraine Military commissars were opposed in the Carpathian region and the Dnieper On February 6, the governor of the Kherson region Vladimir Saldo called the opinion of Major General of the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) Christian Freuding about mobilization in Ukraine disgusting cynicism. February 5 Freuding in interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) stated that Ukraine needs to mobilize more soldiers due to increasing losses in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the need to rotate troops. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces military has no hope of demobilization. On the same day, Reuters reported that many of them are confident that they will have to fight until the end of the conflict and there is simply no other choice. Ukrainian officials also acknowledge problems with personnel in the army. On February 1, ex-commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny said that the Ukrainian army would not be able to be completed without “unpopular measures” (he did not specify which ones). The partial monopolization of the defense industry in Ukraine seriously interferes with the supply of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he noted. On January 30, a new bill on mobilization was introduced to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. It spells out a new method of conscription: all those liable for military service must open a special personal account where they will send electronic summonses. There are also new sanctions for draft dodgers: if they fail to comply with the requirements of the military registration and enlistment office, their bank cards and driver’s licenses will be blocked, as well as prohibited from traveling abroad. Martial law in Ukraine has been in effect since February 2022. At the same time, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization.

The minister suggested that this problem is connected with the upcoming presidential elections in the United States and with the elections to the European Parliament, which will be held in 2024. Marchenko also noted “geopolitical changes”, which may be associated with the weakness of the West. In addition, he emphasized that the Kyiv authorities are forced to make “twice as much effort” in negotiations with their partners compared to the previous year 2022.

This statement was made on Friday, November 24, by the head of the faction of the pro-presidential Servant of the People party in the Verkhovna Rada and member of the Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, David Arakhamia, on the 1+1 TV channel. He said that in the spring of 2022, Russia announced the conditions ceasefire. If Ukraine agreed to them, the conflict could end. “They (the Russians. - Ed.) were ready to end the military conflict if we accepted neutrality, like Finland once did. And we will make a commitment that we will not join NATO. This is the main point,” the Strana.ua publication quoted him as saying in its Telegram channel. Further, answering the question why Ukraine did not agree to such conditions, he said that one of the reasons was Johnson’s call “let’s just fight ”, which he voiced when he visited Kyiv. The former prime minister then indicated that he did not want to sign anything with the Russians, Arakhamia added.

He opposed holding peace talks with Russia, despite the dire situation of the Ukrainian army. In mid-October, Putin said that Ukraine needed to lift the decree prohibiting negotiations if it wanted to begin the negotiation process.

"11 April 2023","Ukraine has neither the forces nor the means for a counter-offensive. With the help of document leaks, the United States is trying to absolve itself of responsibility for the possible failure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Military observer, retired colonel Viktor Litovkin told Izvestia about this on April 11. Thus, he commented on an article by The Washington Post with reference to published American intelligence documents that a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive risks not meeting expectations due to problems with resources “Ukraine needs this offensive in order to show that it has a strong army, that it can defeat Russia, and that the assistance provided by the United States is not in vain. But in reality she has neither the strength nor the means for this. The amount of equipment that it has does not correspond to the offensive tasks that they want to accomplish,” Litovkin said. According to him, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have few tanks, armored personnel carriers, trained crews, and not enough personnel. “But, most importantly, they have no aviation. No offensive is conceivable unless it is protected and supported from above by aviation, attack aircraft, bombers, attack helicopters, and so on. Ukraine doesn’t have all this, so the United States allowed this leak to show that we gave Ukraine everything, but not feed for the horse. And so they failed this offensive, we have nothing to do with it, it’s because Ukraine is so stupid,” the expert concluded. The leak does not work: who benefits from the leaks of American intelligence services The version of disinformation does not stand up to criticism As the former head of the Anti-Aircraft Missile Forces of the Russian Air Force Special Forces Command, reserve colonel Sergei Khatylev, said on April 11, Ukrainian militants will not be able to carry out an effective counter-offensive, since they have the first priority. there won't be enough manpower. As Khatylev recalled, the Ukrainian militants themselves have long been saying that they do not have enough ammunition. The leak of two large batches of files from the US defense department became known on April 6. We are talking about approximately 100 documents that contain information about Kyiv’s combat capabilities, NATO support and the vulnerability of the Ukrainian army. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

"25 August 2023","The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) used phosphorus in the Zaporizhia direction, not far from Zherebyanka and Pyatikhatki. The head of the surgical department of a separate medical battalion of the 58th Army of the Russian Armed Forces, who works on the front line, spoke about this on Friday, August 25. “The use of phosphorus was noticed in the area of Zherebyanka and Pyatikhatki. <...> Thank God, our anesthesiologists identified this lesion in time, and measures were quickly taken - evacuation, sanitary treatment,” RIA Novosti quoted the doctor as saying. He also said that if the media starts talking about the desire of NATO countries supply the Kyiv regime with any weapons, this means, as a rule, that they are already beginning to be used at the front. “That is, they are already here. It begins to be applied on this day,” the agency’s interlocutor emphasized. Evil spirits: what is the danger of supplying Ukraine with shells with depleted uranium? And how Russia will respond to the use of weapons with a nuclear component. The fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are using phosphorus ammunition was previously reported throughout the special operation. For example, the ataman of the Terek Cossack army, Vitaly Kuznetsov, spoke about the use of prohibited shells using phosphorus back in January of this year. In addition, Ukrainian militants began to use ammunition supplied by the West with depleted uranium, which leads to contamination of the ground. The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova recalled on August 25 that in May of this year in the Khmelnitsky region of Ukraine a significant surge in background radiation was recorded from 80 nanosieverts to 140–160 nanosieverts due to the explosion of ammunition with depleted uranium in a warehouse in Khmelnitsky.

Thus, US Department of Defense spokesman Patrick Ryder said in April that American troops do not take part in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. However, the permanent representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, said that Russia is receiving more and more evidence that the West is becoming more involved in conflict, including through the participation of the military.

American journalist Garland Nixon stated this on September 30 on his YouTube blog. “I believe that the Russians are playing for the long haul. I believe they will launch an offensive. <…> They see now that [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky has big problems,” he said. As Nixon noted, the Russian command has chosen tactics that are aimed at Kyiv being completely exhausted - so much so that in the end everything will lead to the downfall of the entire country.

He called on the West to carefully monitor how Russia builds up its military power and increase defense spending. Keeping silent about arsenals: what does Russia's withdrawal from the CFE Treaty mean? Of the basic agreements with the West, only the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remains.

Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the CFE Treaty has not reflected the existing realities in the sphere of European security for several decades.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced this on Tuesday, February 28, at an international conference in Helsinki. Elusive fighters: NATO countries did not promise planes to Kyiv How the ninth meeting in the Ramstein format ended “I will say that since the beginning of the conflict there are no risk-free options, but a much greater risk comes from a Russian victory, which will confirm that the use of force can bring political result,” Stoltenberg noted. Earlier, in February, British military analyst Sean Bell pointed out that NATO was depleting its arsenal by supporting Ukraine and did not have the resources to confront Russia. In his opinion, the alliance did not provide for a conflict of this magnitude in its budget. On February 23, in a conversation with Izvestia, a former US intelligence officer spoke about the depletion of military reserves of Western countries due to supplies to Ukraine. He noted that American reserves of military equipment are not limitless; Western allied countries are also aware of the limitations of weapons arsenals and behind the scenes they are trying to convey to Zelensky that sooner or later they will simply have nothing to supply the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Today it is very difficult for Europe to simply get out of this situation and say that we probably need to stop. This will be a very serious political defeat for the authorities in NATO countries.

Official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova stated this on February 9 in a conversation with Izvestia. “Recruitment for the diplomatic service in America is carried out not through competition in the professional environment, but as a result of, so to speak, political squabbles, <...> including through contribution to the election campaign is purely financial,” the diplomat indicated. She explained that the appointment of ambassadors occurs in proportion to the financial support of the election campaign. In addition, diplomacy in the United States has been lost as a craft, as a way of thinking and as an option for resolving certain problems, the diplomat noted. “Bet on force, bet on blackmail, bet on pressure, and with variations.

The representative of the diplomatic department also spoke about propaganda in the United States. According to her, Americans used to talk about how great they were, based on real achievements, including economic growth, success in science and culture.

"July 2023","Without direct NATO intervention in the conflict in Ukraine, the defeat of Kyiv will be only a matter of time, French Army General Jean-Bernard Pinatel said on Wednesday, July 5, in an interview with Le Dialogue. According to him, the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) was initially doomed to failure , since the Russian Armed Forces (RF Armed Forces) are superior to the Ukrainian ones not only in human resources, but also in technology. “I absolutely do not believe in the success of the Ukrainian counter-offensive. The Russians have significant air superiority. But they also have an advantage on the ground. Even the Ukrainians themselves admit that they fire 4 thousand shells a day, while Russia fires 20 thousand,” he said. According to the French general’s estimates, the ratio of losses between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Russian Armed Forces is 5 to 1 in favor of Russia, and The West's position of prolonging the conflict only leads to an increase in the number of victims. At the same time, neither the United States nor Europe takes into account Kyiv’s losses, since their true goal is to weaken Moscow, Pinatel said. In his opinion, the policy of endless Western sanctions against Russia ultimately caused the greatest damage to Europe itself and put it in danger of economic crisis. In particular, the economies of European countries cannot cope without cheap Russian energy resources, and if Germany falls into recession without Russian gas, this will have a negative impact not only on France, but on the entire EU, Pinatel believes. “Russia, on the contrary, is prospering and develops economically. This is because Russia is independent from the rest of the world in all respects, be it raw materials, grain or energy. But the capitalist world cannot do without the resources supplied by Russia,” he said. In addition, the French general said that Washington is not interested in the well-being of Europe, but in its weakening, in order to prevent it from pursuing an independent and independent policy. “Americans.” “undoubtedly want to avoid economic cooperation between Europe and Russia, which would deprive them of their supremacy in the international arena,” Pinatel concluded. A striking target: what weapons are used to repel the Ukrainian counter-offensive? The latest high-precision weapons are used in defensive battles. Earlier that day, American ex-intelligence officer Scott Ritter said that Kyiv’s only chance to turn the tide on the battlefield is to drag NATO into the conflict. However, NATO has neither the troops, nor the training, nor the logistical support for this, he believes. On June 26, the Politico newspaper noted that the Ukrainian counteroffensive is not being delayed intentionally; its progress is hampered by Russian aircraft, minefields and bad weather conditions. At the same time, US officials recommend that Kyiv make a “breakthrough” through Russian defensive positions now.

"26 April 2023","On April 26, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Property, Land and Property Relations Sergei Gavrilov, in a conversation with Izvestia, assessed the introduction of temporary management of foreign assets in the Russian Federation. The day before, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on retaliatory measures in the event of the seizure of Russian assets abroad. It is noted that in the event of seizure or restriction of rights to Russian property abroad, external management of the assets of unfriendly countries in the Russian Federation is introduced. According to the decree, the corresponding measures also apply to the confiscation of property of Russian citizens and companies. Gavrilov noted that the measures that will follow in connection with the signing of the decree are symmetrical and have long been expected. He noted that the measures should affect not only assets in the energy sector, and in the future the list will be expanded. “If we are talking about symmetrical measures, then in the near future, for example, the issue of Raiffeisenbank assets will arise. Let me remind you that the assets of many Russian companies abroad, including such as Rosneft, VTB, are frozen, do not generate income, no one has compensated the owners for lost profits,” the deputy said. He emphasized that Russia will not take away property, We are only talking about transferring it to temporary management. Thus, while maintaining the ownership structure, the assets of foreign companies in Russia cannot be used to harm the country, the parliamentarian specified. “This could be, for example, non-compliance with Russian legislation, staff reduction, poor quality service, and so on. In order for enterprises to operate in the country in good faith, pay taxes, fulfill investment obligations, obligations to suppliers, they need control. Issues related to the management of foreign assets in the Russian Federation have been repeatedly raised by the State Duma Committee on Property Issues; we positively assess the optimal form of these response measures found,” concluded Gavrilov. Reversing: Europe has abandoned Russian reserves What will happen next with our money and investments in the West On April 13, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said that Washington was considering the possibility of redirecting frozen Bank of Russia reserves to Ukraine. Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov indicated on March 10 that the Russian side considers the freezing of Russian assets to be a violation of international law and an encroachment on state and private property, as well as the foundations of the global economy.

He noted that the only solution in the current difficult situation for Ukraine would be the resignation of the current head of state. Earlier, on October 25, the US House of Representatives elected Republican Mike Johnson as speaker on the fourth attempt. Later, he stated that he first of all intended to submit for consideration a bill to support Israel, without mentioning the possibility of the lower house discussing legislative measures in order to allocate additional funds to Ukraine. Also on this day, political scientist Marat Bashirov expressed the opinion that if the US Congress is elected speaker Republican candidate, with help Ukraine will have problems. At the same time, the political scientist added that one should not overestimate the influence of the speaker of Congress, since this is not a completely independent figure. The position is held by politicians as a result of compromises made between Democrats and Republicans. The position of head of the US House of Representatives became vacant on October 3, after members of Congress voted to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy for the first time in United States history. The reason for this was the resignation of his colleague Matt Gaetz, who on October 2 accused McCarthy of lying to Congress in connection with the decision to finance the government.

"19 February 2024","Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski expressed disappointment at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union (EU) held in Brussels, saying that it failed to achieve progress on the issue of supplies of ammunition to Ukraine. His words were reported on February 19 by the Polish Press Agency (PAR). “With regret I have to state that there is no progress on this issue (supply of ammunition to Kyiv - Ed.). <…> The situation in Ukraine is beginning to be dramatic. I called for a decision to be made in accordance with the call of the Ukrainian Minister [of Foreign Affairs Dmitry Kuleba]. I am dissatisfied with the results of this council,” said the Polish minister. According to Sikorski, there are countries that are blocking the launch of a special line of financing for the defense of Ukraine in the European Peace Fund, and there are no other sources of financing for the supply of ammunition. “The enthusiasm of Western countries for military support for Kyiv is fading” Russian Ambassador to the Netherlands Vladimir Tarabrin - about the supply of F-16 aircraft to Ukraine, diplomatic relations with the kingdom and the election of the President of the Russian Federation Earlier that day, Kuleba demanded that the EU abandon arms supplies to third countries in favor of Kyiv. He stressed that the countries of the association should find opportunities to expand supplies to the Ukrainian army, conclude more long-term contracts to establish new production lines outside the association and look for shells to transfer to Kyiv in other countries. The day before, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said that the EU “took the figure out of thin air” 1 million artillery ammunition for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). According to him, when calculations of real possibilities began, it turned out that the EU “does not have such opportunities.” A day earlier, on February 17, Czech President Petr Pavel, during a speech at the Munich Security Conference, said that the country had found sources abroad for hundreds of thousands units of artillery ammunition, which it could deliver to Ukraine in a matter of weeks. He also noted that the Czech Republic is seeking to attract funding from the United States, Germany, Sweden or other countries that provide arms assistance to Ukraine. In November 2023, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said that the EU would not be able to fulfill its promises to supply Ukraine with 1 million shells by March 2024. Then he clarified that it would take several additional months to achieve such a volume. The European Union approved a plan to transfer 1 million artillery shells to Kiev within 12 months at the end of March last year. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kiev against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, about the beginning which was announced on February 24, 2022 by Russian President Vladimir Putin after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

"17 June 2023","African countries have shown an understanding of the true causes of the conflict in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters about this on Saturday, June 17, following negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and a delegation from African countries. “The main conclusion from today’s conversation: our partners from the African Union showed an understanding of the true causes of the crisis that was created by the efforts of the West, and showed an understanding that it is necessary to get out of this situation by addressing these underlying causes,” Lavrov said. As the diplomat pointed out, the Ukrainian crisis arose as a result of many years of the hybrid war of the West against Russia. Negotiations with delegations from countries Africa lasted more than three hours. In particular, during this meeting, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the proposal of African countries regarding Ukraine is based on 10 elements, including peaceful resolution of the conflict, early start of negotiations, de-escalation, sovereignty of states in accordance with the UN Charter, security guarantees for each party , implementation of the grain deal, humanitarian support for victims, exchange of prisoners and return of children, “post-war reconstruction”, closer cooperation with African countries. Southern side: in Africa they are ready to help the Russian Federation and Ukraine with the exchange of prisoners When representatives of the continent visit St. Petersburg and Kyiv, Putin, in turn, recalled that Russia is open to dialogue with all countries that advocate peace. He also emphasized that he welcomes the approach of African leaders to resolving the situation. The last face-to-face round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place on March 29, 2022 in Turkey. Later, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow.

"July 19 2023","Russian senators appealed to the world's parliaments and international organizations with a request to condemn the United States for supplying cluster munitions to Ukraine. The decision was made during a meeting in the Federation Council on Wednesday, July 19. In the statement, the senators indicated that if the Ukrainian side uses this type of ammunition, Russia reserves the right to a “hard mirror response.” At the same time, the very delivery of these weapons to Kyiv can be considered useless, since it will not affect the course of the Russian special operation in any way. Since Washington agreed to the supply of cluster munitions, it will be responsible for the deaths of civilians, the document states. At the same time, the promises of the Ukrainian authorities to use ammunition “carefully and responsibly” are insignificant, and the United States understands this. Hands free: what response will the Russian Federation give to the supply of cluster munitions to Kyiv? Sergei Shoigu stated Russia’s superiority in the effectiveness and diversity of this type of weapons. Earlier, on July 17, the international committee of the Federation Council condemned the decision of the United States to supply cluster munitions to Kyiv and expressed concern about the supply of this type of ammunition On July 13, the Pentagon confirmed the transfer of cluster munitions to Kyiv. Prior to this, on July 7, US President Joe Biden called the supply of these shells a temporary step aimed at supporting Ukraine. At the same time, on the same day, US Presidential National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan assured that Washington had received written guarantees from the Ukrainian side that these shells allegedly will be used “with caution” to avoid risk to civilians. On July 16, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the supply of cluster bombs to Ukraine to be treated as a crime, saying the United States made this decision because it lacks other munitions. Use of cluster munitions prohibited by the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which came into force on August 1, 2010, it was signed by 123 countries, but ratified by only 110. Of the European countries, the convention was not signed by Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Greece, Georgia, Latvia, Poland, the Russian Federation, Romania, Serbia , Turkey, Ukraine, Finland and Estonia.

"27 November 2023","number of Western officials fear that Kyiv could collapse in the special operation zone this winter. The Wall Street Journal reported this on Monday, November 27. According to the publication, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are experiencing a shortage of infantry due to heavy losses. The article also drew attention to the conscription system: men in their 40s are often sent into the trenches with little training. The lack of ammunition also means Kyiv is unlikely to be able to mount another major offensive for some time, The Wall Street Journal adds. “European countries are running out of stocks of weapons and ammunition that they can transfer to Ukraine. Political disagreements in Washington have already slowed U.S. supplies. Shells from South Korea helped Ukrainian artillery reach parity with Russian forces for part of this year,” the publication explained. Two minus two equals four: the West-East split is intensifying in the EU. What, besides aid to Ukraine, divides the countries of the Visegrad Group and Brussels Recently, more and more statements about the defeat of Ukraine have begun to appear. In particular, on November 20, European Deputy Gunnar Beck said in a conversation with Izvestia that Kyiv is unlikely to be able to win the confrontation. He noted that Ukraine’s victory was initially an illusion. Beck noted that ultimately the number of Ukrainian losses could push the EU towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict, since Russia's position is becoming stronger. On the same day, French ex-diplomat Gerard Harault said that on the battlefield the situation is in Russia's favor, and Ukraine is capable continue fighting only with financial support from Western countries and military assistance from the United States. Also on November 20, columnist Peter van Buren, in an article for The American Conservative, expressed the opinion that Ukraine will lose the conflict, just like all the countries it has ever supported Washington. He pointed out that the US has a habit of getting involved in a conflict and then losing interest. According to the journalist, the terms of the conflict resolution will be dictated to Kyiv not only by Washington, but also by Moscow, and the end will be sad for the Ukrainian leadership. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced on February 24 last year, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"April 1 2023","Residents of the Italian city of Verona opposed the policies of the European Union (EU) and NATO, which fuel militaristic sentiments. TASS reported this on Saturday, April 1. “The brotherhood of peoples is being built from below, in the squares. We are disappointed with our authorities. As a result, this government is no different from the previous one, subordinate to NATO and the EU, which want to plunge us into a total war,” explained one of the initiators of the event, President of the Veneto-Russia Association Palmarino Zoccatelli. He also added that this is not the first and not the last such performance. About 200 people took part in the action. In addition, teleconferences were organized with like-minded people in Belgrade (Serbia) and Tivat (Montenegro). Initially, it was planned to connect Chisinau, but this idea had to be abandoned due to “political pressure.” The rally was held in the central square of Verona. Protesters symbolically cut the EU and NATO flags “as a sign of complete disagreement with what these organizations are doing to Europe and towards Russia.” In addition, journalist Eliseo Bertolasi, who visited Donbass several times over the past year, addressed the audience. They produced a package: what new measures have the West introduced against the Russian Federation? The sanctions against the banking sector look most sensitive, but the majority of citizens are unlikely to be affected by the next restrictions. Earlier, on March 11, it was reported that a rally was held in Bern for Switzerland to maintain neutrality regarding the events in Ukraine. During the rally, there was a call for “an immediate end to sanctions against Russia and the return of Switzerland to 100 percent neutrality.” Also on this day, more than 2 thousand people took to the streets of the Spanish city of Bilbao as part of a march in support of Russia. The protesters expressed their position against the NATO strategy, military support for Kyiv and the increase in the military budgets of EU countries. They demanded the redistribution of these resources to other, more important areas for people. Western countries increased pressure on Moscow in connection with the conduct of a special military operation to protect Donbass, the decision to launch which was made by Russian President Vladimir Putin against the background of the worsening situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

It is noted that mayors from Ukrainian settlements were invited to the regional forum. Thus, the event will promote Russophobia to Latin American partners. “For these purposes, mayors from supposedly “besieged” settlements in Ukraine have been brought to the regional forum. The declared participation of the self-proclaimed mayor of Melitopol, who has no authority in this Russian city, looks especially odious,” the diplomatic mission said in a message on the Telegram channel. The embassy added that it would be better to invite representatives of Donbass, whose residents are surviving, to the event in the American state under fire since 2014. Then the summit would not look like propaganda to justify the “crimes of the Kyiv regime.” Ours to yours: will Latin America expand military cooperation with the Russian Federation How the Ukrainian crisis affected the struggle between Washington and Moscow for influence in the region Earlier, on April 26, Russian senator Alexei Pushkov announced the powerlessness of the West in Latin America. As confirmation, he cited the situation with the failure of opposition leader Juan Guaido in the presidential elections in Venezuela. He clarified that the United States was pushing Guaido to this post with all its might. On April 21, Russian Ambassador to Brazil Alexei Labetsky noted that the implementation of independent policies by Latin American countries is rejected by the United States, since Washington only values what is its propaganda. Meanwhile, on April 14 Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, in a statement, blamed the United States of America for inciting the conflict in Ukraine. He emphasized that it was none other than Washington that put Russia in a situation incompatible with self-defense. In February, the permanent representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, noted that Russia no longer has confidence in the West, so “living as before” is no longer possible it will work out.

Earlier on Tuesday, the Iltalehti publication, citing Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen, reported that the country’s authorities would make a decision in the next few weeks on increasing the production of artillery ammunition for Ukraine. “In this case, a clearly unfriendly step on the part of Finland. Finland wants to bend to NATO, to show that they are ahead of the rest. No one has shells anymore - neither Germany, nor France, but Finland does, it is ahead of NATO,” said Perendzhiev. According to the political scientist, in this case, Finland is pursuing the goal of increasing its importance in NATO and in general among Western countries countries, using the Ukrainian crisis for this. “Finland has become the frontier of NATO” Experts assessed the likelihood of escalation on the republic’s border with Russia According to the head of the Finnish Ministry of Defense, plans for the production of ammunition for Kyiv are already ready, and the decision to begin production will presumably be made before December 25.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated this on July 19. “Let the West discuss every day the imaginary offensive of Ukraine, the difficulties Russia creates for a counter-offensive and for achieving their (Ukrainian authorities. - Ed.) goals of liberating the entire territory up to the 1991 borders,” noted the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with the heads of Russian non-profit organizations. The situation changed: the Russian army advanced in the Kupyansk direction. Also, the Russian Armed Forces launched a massive retaliation strike for the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge.

"December 3 2023","The United States will not allow Russia to win in the conflict in Ukraine and will continue to support Kyiv with military aid supplies. This was stated by the country's Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Saturday, December 2, speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California. Austin repeatedly listed the main opponents of the United States, naming China, Hamas and Russia in a single bundle. For the United States, he secured the role of a peacemaker, creator and unifying force. “As President [Joe] Biden said, “American leadership is what holds the world together.” Our rivals and enemies want to divide and weaken the United States—and separate us from our allies and partners. So at this critical juncture in history, America must not hesitate,” he said in a speech published on the Pentagon website. Austin emphasized that the country is capable of meeting its obligations and supplying resources to multiple theaters of war. So Israel will remain an ally and recipient of US support unconditionally. “And we will not allow our enemies to divide or weaken us. Therefore, even as we increase support for Israel, we remain focused on Ukraine,” the defense chief added. Austin Chondrosis: The United States and Germany are reconsidering assistance to Ukraine Who might benefit from a truce in 2024 Earlier, on November 27, John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the White House National Security Council, said that financial support for Ukraine from the United States is at a critical moment. He also recalled that the assistance package for Ukraine is awaiting approval from Congress. The day before, on November 26, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced that the upper house of Congress would vote on Biden’s request for assistance to Ukraine and Israel on December 4. The Senate will also vote on the allocation of additional national security assistance. Prior to this, on November 21, Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said that the United States would be able to continue providing assistance to Kyiv only if the American Congress approved the allocation of additional funds from the federal budget. A day earlier. Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, during a visit to Kiev, announced that the United States would provide Ukraine with a new tranche of military assistance worth $100 million. At the same time, the Russian Ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov on November 21 called the new package of military assistance to Kyiv a “calming pill.” He indicated that the situation at the front and in the Ukrainian government is on the verge of collapse. On November 19, NBC News, citing sources, reported that the US Congress expects to approve the Biden administration's request for assistance to Ukraine and Israel, as well as to ensure the security of the southern border, by the end of 2023 .On November 17, Biden signed a bill to finance the work of the country’s government without assistance to Ukraine. The stopgap funding bill approved by both houses of the US Congress also does not provide for aid to Israel.

"17 October 2023","On October 17, the White House confirmed the transfer of ATACMS missiles with a range of 165 km to Ukraine. This was stated in a statement by the head of the press service of the White House National Security Council, Adrienne Watson. “The United States recently provided Ukraine with ATACMS, whose range is up to 165 km. We believe this will significantly increase Ukraine’s combat potential without risking our combat readiness,” TASS quoted her as saying. Also on that day, it became known that the Pentagon could not confirm further deliveries of ATACMS to Kyiv. The department does not yet have this information. Two American officials also announced the transfer of ATACMS missiles to Kyiv in an interview with CNN. The confirmation came Tuesday after images of missile submunitions inside Ukraine began circulating on social media. U.S. officials told CNN that Ukraine has already used the ATACMS system, some variants of which have a maximum range of about 186 miles (nearly 300 km), to attacks on the Russian airfields of Berdyansk and Lugansk in eastern Ukraine. For missile purposes: the Russian army launched eight strikes on Ukraine. A number of important installations of the UFU naval saboteurs were damaged. According to The Wall Street Journal, a small number of ATACMS were secretly sent to Ukraine in recent days. The AP agency clarified that Kyiv received missiles with cluster warheads. When fired, the ammunition expands, releasing hundreds of bombs. The missiles have a shorter flight range than the maximum possible range of 300 km. CNN noted that by secretly supplying long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine, the United States hoped to catch Russia by surprise. Since Washington usually announces arms supplies to Ukraine, however, in some cases it does not disclose this information, as was the case with HARM missiles. In addition, on this day, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky confirmed the use of ATACMS long-range missiles. He stated that his agreements with Biden were being fulfilled. On October 17, Izvestia also received footage of the wreckage of an American ATACMS missile shot down in the Northern Military District zone. In early October, a former special forces officer, retired colonel Anatoly Matviychuk, in a conversation with Izvestia, said that the missiles ATACMS, even if they are transferred to Kyiv, will not give the Ukrainian Armed Forces an advantage on the battlefield. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 by Russian leader Vladimir Putin after the aggravation of the situation in region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"25 January 2024","Hungary will abandon its objections to the creation by the European Union (EU) of a new fund for military assistance to Ukraine, the volume of which will be €5 billion. Bloomberg writes about this, citing sources on Thursday, January 25. “Budapest said that it will not interfere with the achievement of consensus at the meeting of ambassadors European Union on Wednesday, where an agreement on a larger financial aid package of €50 billion remains unresolved,” the agency writes and notes that reaching an agreement on the creation of a fund will pave the way for “modernizing the mechanism for ensuring stable arms supplies” to Ukraine. At the same time, Bloomberg connects the rejection of Hungary's objections with the fact that pressure is growing on the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban over the issue of Sweden's admission to NATO. Stockholm and Helsinki submitted applications to join the bloc in May 2022, but the ratification of their membership was delayed. Later, on April 4, 2023, only Finland officially joined the alliance. Let's go from principles: they want to deprive Hungary of the right to vote What mechanisms does this lay down and will Budapest stop making contributions to the EU budget? Hungary, at a meeting in Brussels on Ukraine, which took place on December 14–15, blocked the allocation of €50 billion to Kyiv. In the same month, the Prime Minister Hungarian Minister Viktor Orban suggested that the EU refrain from aid to Ukraine over the next five years, noting that the €50 billion that the union is going to transfer to Kyiv simply does not exist. On January 22, Bloomberg wrote that the EU plans to accept an aid package to Kyiv on February 1 at a summit in Brussels. If Hungary blocks the initiative again, the alliance countries will deprive it of its voting rights and make a decision without it. As specified, the preparation of this scenario has been going on for a long time, but European officials see this as a risk of expanding tensions between the leaders of the association. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which began on February 24, 2022 due to the worsening situation in region as a result of Ukrainian shelling.

In addition, the mayor also recalled that the amount of debt to Kiev over two years is about 6.8 billion hryvnia (about $156 million), while in the country it has already reached 36 billion hryvnia ($940 million). Despite the fact that the government and the president Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky promised to pay off debts; at the moment, “heating enterprises are operating at enormous losses and the city cannot independently cover such colossal funds,” Klitschko explained. Dark affairs: why the Ukrainian energy sector will never recover In Kyiv, they announced a huge shortage of electricity. Earlier, on September 7, it became known that a month before the start of the heating season, heating and communal energy enterprises (CHE) of Ukraine are forced to stop supplying hot water and initiate their own bankruptcy. In addition, Decree of the Government of Ukraine dated August 22, 2023 No. 896 deprived enterprises of the opportunity to purchase natural gas under the PSO regime to provide services to the population. On July 30, Prime Minister Denis Shmygal, at a meeting of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities in Ivano-Frankivsk, stated that Ukraine had received the necessary means for entering the heating season. He added that Ukraine has already received €166 million within the European Energy Support Fund. A day earlier, on July 29, Advisor to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak noted that the next winter for Ukrainians may be more difficult than the previous one.

"28 February 2023","The use of chemical weapons in a special operation zone and further blaming Russia for this is quite in the spirit of Washington. Dmitry Belik, a member of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, told Izvestia about this on February 28. Line of contact: Russian troops are pushing back the enemy near Seversk VFU are losing bridgeheads suitable for organizing a spring offensive, experts say. As the deputy noted, the United States has chosen for itself the role of “peacemaker,” but in fact it is the source of most conflict situations in the world. “List of countries.” There are dozens of states in which US policies after World War II led to destabilization. It is noteworthy that the reason for overt interference in the affairs of other countries is often precisely provocations carried out by American intelligence services,” he said. According to Belik, Washington in its tactics is ready to stoop to the lowest provocations. “The use of chemical weapons in the Northern Military District zone with further accusations in this Russia is quite in the spirit of Washington, which does not shy away from any methods to achieve what it wants and, along with the supply of weapons and equipment, resorts to chemical weapons,” the parliamentarian said. Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria are examples of where the United States used ammunition with chemical weapons, he added deputy. “It is enough to remember that the White Helmets organization has discredited itself with far-fetched and false accusations against Damascus. This organization, created by the British military, was funded by the governments of Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as the US Agency for International Development, and recorded on video allegedly “evidence of the use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Assad.” The fact that these films are fake was confirmed by the Syrians themselves. And what is this if not pure cynicism on the part of the United States and its allies?” - he said. Belik pointed out that the United States, using various reasons, retained both chemical and biological weapons. He recalled that during the special operation, information was obtained about Washington’s military-biological activities on the territory of Ukraine. “At the same time, the United States did not bear responsibility for this, as well as for its other illegal activities,” the parliamentarian concluded. On February 22, an influential American non-governmental organization held a conference dedicated to events in Ukraine. During the event, former US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan made a statement saying that “Russian troops plan to use chemical weapons in a special military operation zone.” On February 28, the head of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops of the Russian Armed Forces, Igor Kirillov, said that the U.S. and their accomplices intend to organize a provocation in Ukraine using toxic chemicals, blaming Russia for this. Kirillov also said that the United States has retained samples of the toxic substance BZ, the complete destruction of which was announced more than 30 years ago. According to him, back in 1990, Washington reported the disposal of about 50 tons of the BZ substance, but at the same time the United States left its samples.

The first five points were worked out at the meeting in Malta, the next ones at the meeting in Switzerland. As soon as it is formulated, it will be transferred to Russia, he indicated. On December 17, former adviser to the head of the Pentagon, Colonel Douglas McGregor, said that the intransigence of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky regarding the need to begin negotiations with Russia instead of continuing military operations could exterminate the country’s population. He stressed that Zelensky needed billions to continue the conflict after a peace agreement was close. The New York Times reported on December 13 that Western countries hope to persuade Ukraine to negotiate with Russia, as they see this as the only way to restore peace. It was also noted that support for Kyiv from the West is becoming less and less.

This was stated by the nephew of the 35th President of the United States, Robert Kennedy Jr., who announced his candidacy for the post of head of the White House. “The Russians cannot lose. We are told that they are losing. They are building up their forces, they have an artillery advantage over the United States,” he said in an interview with the All-In Podcast on May 5. According to Kennedy, the United States does not have artillery to replace the equipment destroyed during the fighting. He pointed out that Kyiv and Washington are “trying their best” to hide the “catastrophic losses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.” Battle arithmetic: in April, the UAF lost 15 thousand people. Ukrainian formations will be seriously drained of blood by the fall, which will affect their combat effectiveness, experts say. Earlier, on April 20, Kennedy said that the US authorities do not tell their citizens that Russian troops are in within the framework of the Ukrainian conflict it is impossible to resist. The politician wondered what the United States had forgotten in Ukraine. However, on May 5, ex-US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter said that from a military point of view, the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have the opportunity to defeat the Russian army; Kyiv will be defeated by the beginning of autumn.

Line of contact: Russian troops are pushing back the enemy near Seversk VFU are losing bridgeheads suitable for organizing a spring offensive, experts say. According to McGregor, the Ukrainian army has no chance of winning on the battlefield. “The Americans will again do what they already did after Vietnam. We dumped the remaining equipment, which, in our opinion, was worthless, into the South China Sea, sailed away, and no one remembered it again,” the expert suggested in a conversation with journalist Stephen Gardner, the recording of which was published on YouTube. The former Pentagon adviser emphasized that the United States, as an air and sea power, always has the opportunity to board a plane or ship and return home if the balance of the parties is not in their favor. Moreover, McGregor recalled the experience of American military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, saying that the US population will quickly switch from the topic of Ukraine to another topic. Earlier, on March 4, Douglas McGregor suggested that Vladimir Zelensky, after the defeat of Ukraine, would have to flee to the West to hide. He explained that the Ukrainian leader and his inner circle have large bank accounts in Cyprus. At the same time, McGregor expressed his conviction that the United States and its allies see Zelensky exclusively as an actor who copes well with the role he received. On February 27, Douglas McGregor admitted that Zelensky, after the end of military assistance from the United States, could flee to Florida. He explained that the American army does not have as strong ground forces as Russia, which is why their allies on land are literally left alone with the enemy.

He said this in an interview with the Consortiumnews portal. “The West has staked a lot on its war against Russia.” Lavrov summed up the activities of Russian diplomacy in 2022. He noted that “there were factors” behind Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a special operation. “Definitely, in his opinion, there was a certain justification for this. And it (the special operation - Ed.) did not occur without justification. The expansion of NATO, the idea that Ukraine would join NATO - this caused concern,” the journalist said. In addition, he recalled that the United States installed missiles on the border with China, which Washington calls “defensive.” According to Hersh, they can easily be “converted into missiles that can destroy Moscow within 7-8 minutes.” In this regard, the journalist concluded that the United States “also showed a lot of aggression.” Hersh also called the United States the most aggressive country in the world at the moment. Earlier, on February 12, the former Prime Minister of Italy, leader of the Forward Italy! Silvio Berlusconi said that it would be enough for Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to stop attacks on the Donbass republics so as not to force Russia to carry out a special operation. On December 19, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that a special military operation was absolutely necessary to thwart plans to transform Ukraine to ""anti-Russia"". According to him, the West's reaction reflects the understanding that Moscow's actions ensured the failure of their geopolitical games and plans. Prior to this, on October 8, the former US President indicated that the reason for the start of the Russian special military operation in Ukraine was precisely the rhetoric of the government of the current head of the American state . At the same time, he announced the need for the United States to demand immediate negotiations on a peaceful end to the conflict in order to avoid its escalation into a third world war. The special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, continues.

"29 April 2023","Sooner or later, Kyiv will be left without Washington's support. This forecast was shared by retired US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter on the Judging Freedom YouTube channel. “When we leave, and we will definitely leave, the Ukrainians will be left on their own, with nothing,” he said. According to the expert, it is This is how the American authorities treated Afghanistan: without receiving the desired results, Washington left the republic alone with unresolved internal problems. However, the United States did not have to deal with the consequences of this failed policy. Raise supplies: will Kyiv receive weapons for a counter-offensive? The 11th meeting of the contact group on Ukraine was held in Germany at the American Ramstein base. Earlier, on April 25, American human rights activist Ajamu Baraka said that the administration of US President Joe Biden was preparing for an Afghan scenario in Ukraine.

As Politico emphasized, former Afghan leader Ashraf Ghani received a similar message in 2021 shortly before the fall of Kabul. The day before, The New York Times wrote that if the offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) fails, Western support for Ukraine may weaken, and Kyiv may face growing pressure to enter into serious negotiations to end or freeze the conflict. Prior to this, on April 22, the Financial Times reported that Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky fears the Ukrainian Armed Forces will fail in an attempted offensive. According to senior officials in Kyiv, the country's leadership is concerned that such a failure could prompt Western allies to push the country to begin negotiations with Moscow.

"25 October 2023","The US financial oligarchy is deliberately prolonging the conflict in Ukraine in order to maintain access to the American state budget. This opinion was expressed by Edward Karolchuk, a columnist for the Polish magazine Mysl Polska, on October 23. “Negotiations on any solution to the conflict in Ukraine mean the end of good deals and pumping out the state budget with financial capital,” the article says. According to the Polish columnist, United States producers have made the Ukrainian state arms sales center to circumvent export restrictions, and also took advantage of this conflict to “pump” finances from the US government budget to various private companies in order to support think tanks and business institutions that are associated with leading corporations and the military-industrial complex. It is noted that the profits of such American defense companies as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies and others are especially growing. Karolchuk drew attention to the fact that Russians and Ukrainians are killing each other over the question of whether the United States will remain the “leading imperialist capitalist economy” or American corporations will be forced to share their profits with China. “To date, more than $130 billion has been allocated to help Ukraine, excluding assistance from EU countries,” the observer emphasized.

Later, on October 21, Trump said that the United States was moving towards a third world war due to the incompetent policies of the current American leader. He noted that Biden “has no idea what’s going on.” On October 9, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba expressed the opinion that relations between Washington and Kyiv will become more complicated as the American presidential elections approach. He also accused Trump supporters of the fact that the US Congress did not approve a new aid package for Ukraine. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 by Russian President Vladimir Putin after the escalation situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

British Foreign Minister David Cameron said this on December 7 at the Aspen Security forum, addressing Congress, Bloomberg reports. “If you vote for this package, no matter how you do it and no matter what you link it to in Congress, it will give a huge a boost to these European countries,"" he said during his speech. Cameron stressed that this vote will have a huge impact on Congress because it will allow countries that want to support Ukraine to set an example for other countries next year.

American political scientist Malek Dudakov noted the next day, December 7, that the US Republican Party is using the issue of additional assistance to Ukraine as a lever of pressure on the Democrats. He suggested that the discussion process could drag on until mid-January. The Americanist believes that assistance to Kyiv will be in a smaller volume than requested by the administration of US President Joe Biden, therefore, Republicans and Democrats will take a long time to reach a compromise. Moreover, also on that day, December 6, due to the uncertainty on this issue, Biden spoke with a special appeal, saying that Congress must urgently approve a request for funds for Ukraine. At the same time, Pentagon head Lloyd Austin indicated that Washington is committed to long-term military support for Kyiv even in the face of a delay in the allocation of new assistance.

"April 2023","In the area of biological laboratories controlled by the United States, there is a risk of the spread of dangerous pathogens, said the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defense forces (RCBZ) of the Russian Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov on Friday, April 7, at a briefing on the analysis of documents relating to military biological activities Washington. According to him, the United States Department of Energy, like the Pentagon, organizes and supervises military-biological activities. Moreover, he pointed out that Washington has resumed the construction of a biological laboratory in Ukraine, which had previously been suspended due to a special operation. “It should be noted that the United States has never clearly stated its obligations in the field of safety of research in biological laboratories under its control. The non-transparency of their activities creates a risk of the spread of dangerous pathogens in the areas where biological objects are located,” emphasized the head of the RCBZ. Kirillov also called the US Department of Energy’s funding of the project “Virtual Environment for Research in the Field of Preparation for Biothreats” a dual-use action that conceals a contribution to the creation of biological weapons. At the same time, he noted the involvement of American biological laboratories in the spread of Covid-19. It was the US Department of Energy that published a statement that the virus was of laboratory origin. “A logical question arises: what does the US Department of Energy have to do with the fight against biological threats and [why] is it implementing projects that have dual-use characteristics,” noted the lieutenant general. This development of coronavirus infection strains raises questions among most scientists. Kirillov expressed suspicion that someone is purposefully helping to “strengthen” the pathogenic properties of the virus,” thereby fueling the pandemic without letting it end. Speaking about suspicious vaccines against coronavirus, Kirillov noted the Western Pfizer, which distributed medicines with real risks of pathologies. from the cardiovascular system. With the active use of this vaccine, in 2021, the percentage of patients with myocarditis and pericarditis in the United States has increased. Kirillov drew an analogy with Ukrainian military personnel, on whom the United States tested highly toxic drugs, while the side effects were not fully studied. Pathogenic engineering: US bio-laboratories continue to operate in Ukraine Kyiv has the scientific and technical potential to stage a provocation using dangerous viruses. On April 5, State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said that the final report on US bio-laboratories in Ukraine will be heard on April 11. Earlier, on March 22, Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Irina Yarovaya noted that the investigation into the activities of American biological laboratories in Ukraine confirmed that under their guise there were NATO military facilities in the country, RT reports.

"13 July 2023","Most of those present at the NATO summit in Vilnius were discouraged by the consumerist attitude of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, said Anna van Densky, a member of the Brussels International Press Association, in her YouTube video on July 12. As the journalist noted, the expressed dissatisfaction with the alliance gave rise to talk that the national the leader, and not third countries or organizations, must bear responsibility for his people. “I think he has fewer friends, even if they haven’t said so directly,” said Anna van Densky. She also called the Ukrainian president a “capricious prima donna.” and pointed out that such behavior only alienates the Kiev regime from Western countries. Advice and dislike: how the first meeting in the Ukraine-NATO format ended and what security guarantees the G7 countries offered Kyiv. The day before, the head of the British Ministry of Defense Ben Wallace commented on Zelensky’s criticism of the alliance due to the lack of a specific time frame for Kyiv’s membership in NATO and called on Ukraine to thank the West instead of criticism for arms supplies. The US delegation was also angry because of the words of the Ukrainian leader regarding the uncertain language about inviting the country to NATO. It is specified that members of the US delegation “were furious.” Some NATO politicians said that Zelensky was thus trying to put pressure on the alliance members and gather more allies. On July 11, at the first meeting, members of the military-political bloc published a communiqué in which the allies decided that they would invite Ukraine when they reached unanimity on this issue, and the conditions will become suitable. Thus, the summit document does not reflect either the schedule or the date of Kyiv’s entry into the alliance. On September 30, 2022, Ukraine submitted an application to join NATO on an accelerated basis.

At the same time, McGregor emphasized that Zelensky will not be able to leave his post. In addition, he noted that the West plans to replace the current president of Ukraine with a person capable of starting peace negotiations with Russia. “He (the new protégé of the West - Ed.) will sit down at the negotiating table and discuss the end of the conflict with the Russians,” he concluded ex-Pentagon adviser. “We shouldn’t expect a complete settlement of the Ukrainian crisis in the near future” Political scientist Denis Denisov about the situation in Ukraine Earlier that day, political scientist and expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation Denis Denisov told Izvestia that the statement of the head of the faction of the pro-presidential party of Ukraine “Servant of the People” David Arakhamia’s refusal to negotiate with Russia in 2022 is a rethinking of the positions of the country’s leadership over the past two years.

"19 June 2023","Close cooperation between Kyiv and NATO is delaying the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. This was stated by the director of the second department of the CIS countries of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Alexey Polishchuk, on June 19. “Today’s close cooperation of the Kyiv regime with NATO, even without formalization of membership in the organization, does not bring us closer to peace, but delays the resolution of the crisis,” he said in an interview with TASS.He noted that if the West really cared about security guarantees for Ukraine, then NATO and the United States would begin to insist on the neutral and non-aligned status of Kyiv. At the same time, one of the reasons for the current crisis is ignoring the interests of Moscow. Polishchuk pointed out that since 1990 the Russian side has opposed the bloc’s advance to the borders and warned that “the security of some countries cannot be ensured at the expense of the security of others.” “Neither the West nor the Kyiv regime needs peace in Ukraine” Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Galuzin - about the risks of further NATO expansion to the east and negotiations with Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 16, speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, said that NATO is being drawn into conflict in Ukraine.

He announced this on September 5 in an interview with the German television channel Welt. “Ukraine will not use Taurus cruise missiles outside the internationally recognized borders of our country,” the minister said. Kuleba expressed hope that the delivery of missiles will take place in the near future, noting that the transfer of weapons depends only on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. “I would not like to put pressure on him, but I hope that the decision will be made quickly, and not just in a few months. We have constantly encountered this topic since last year,” the minister added. Having touched on the topic of possible negotiations with Russia, Kuleba took an extremely tough position. The head of Ukrainian diplomacy also noted that he has a negative attitude towards the creation of a demarcation line. In his opinion, such a decision will not contribute to ending the conflict. Not out of fear, but like this: the Russian Armed Forces are holding lines in the Rabotino area. Ukrainian militants are trying to advance in the Zaporozhye direction, but to no avail.

In addition, Kyiv regularly carries out terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation, including using drones. Deliveries of Taurus missiles were planned by the German government in early August. Discussion of this issue began after French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his readiness to transfer long-range missiles to Kyiv on July 11. On August 21, German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said that Germany had not yet made a decision on the transfer of long-range Taurus missiles to Kiev. On August 26, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stressed that all German actions related to future arms supplies to Ukraine will be carefully weighed, and there will be no rash steps in this matter.

He pointed out that the Ukrainian side is constantly asking for help, but Rome has already done a lot for it, and the country’s resources are not endless. “Italy has done a lot.

Forcing peace: how the attitude towards Ukraine has changed over the year The Europeans are pushing Kyiv to negotiate and are less and less ready to help. Earlier, at the end of August, Italian General Marco Bertolini said that from a military point of view, Ukraine’s victory in the conflict is unthinkable. In his opinion, the Ukrainian conflict should have been stopped long ago. The next package of military assistance to Italy was announced to the Ukrainian side at the end of May. A month earlier, Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Antonio Tajani announced that the Italian side would provide assistance to Ukraine in the amount of €1.5 billion. It was noted that the main areas to which the republic allocates funds were infrastructure and finance. Western countries increased sanctions pressure on Russia in connection with a special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to start it was announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of a worsening situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce support for Ukraine.

"July 28 2023","The UK Ministry of Defense has launched an investigation after officials accidentally sent emails containing classified information to a country allied with Russia. This was reported by The Times newspaper on Thursday, July 27. “A number of emails intended to be sent to the Pentagon were accidentally sent to the Russian-allied country of Mali due to a typo,” the article says. It is clarified that British officials sent messages to an address ending in the domain of the West African country “.ml”, and not in the “.mil” of the US military, Gazeta.Ru reports. It is noted that most of the letters sent to Mali did not contain data that could represent threat to UK security. The letters mainly contained information about vacations of military personnel and law enforcement officers. However, some of them still contained classified information, namely detailed descriptions of British research on hypersonic weapons. Treasured materials: Pentagon leak, Dalai Lama scandal, mobilization in Africa Izvestia selected the most curious and shocking events in the world Last week it turned out that the same mistake in the United States led to millions of military emails being sent to Mali. Some of these letters contained confidential information about employees, and the United States of America is concerned about the close connection between Russia and Mali, the Financial Times noted. Prior to this, in April, it became known that two large batches of secret Pentagon documents were leaked at once. At that time, we were talking about approximately 100 documents that related to Kyiv’s combat capabilities, NATO support and the vulnerability of the Ukrainian army. It also follows from documents leaked online that the United States is listening in on South Korea, Israel, and Ukraine.

"March 2024","The German Ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, called the leaked conversation between Bundeswehr officers about the strike on the Crimean Bridge a “good lesson” and called for no apology for the security breaches that caused it. He said this on the BBC on March 6. “I think this is a good lesson for everyone: never use the Internet in a hotel if you want to make a secret call,” Berger said. Responding to criticism from the former British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace that Germany is “heavily penetrated by Russian intelligence” and is “neither safe nor calm,” the diplomat called his words “extremely unhelpful.” In addition, Berger accused Russia of publishing the call and called on the allies to focus on supplying Ukraine with sufficient amount of ammunition. “Scholz will have to remove Pistorius from office” Bundestag deputy Herold Otten - about the scandal in the Bundeswehr, the arms lobby in Germany and the conflict between the Russian Federation and NATO On March 1, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion of senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, which, according to her, took place on February 19. During the conversation, the military discussed the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine. In a fragment of an audio recording from representatives of the German Air Force, officers discussed how many such shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether such a strike would be effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force command Frank Graefe, the Bundeswehr BBC inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. Official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that the German Ambassador to In Moscow, Alexander Lambsdorff did not deny the authenticity of the recording. In turn, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the conversation a demonstration of the involvement of Western countries in the conflict in Ukraine. Peskov emphasized that the recording demonstrates the extreme situation that has developed in Germany. Moscow also hopes to get acquainted with the results of the investigation by the German authorities on this topic. The Ukrainian side is making attempts to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, as this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"21 October 2023","Charge d'Affaires of the Czech Republic in Russia Jan Ondrejka was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Foreign Ministry reported this on October 21. “In response to the recent demarche of the Czech Foreign Ministry, a decisive protest was declared and the Russian position on the situation around Ukraine was stated in detail,” the message says. Among other things, the diplomat was told the ministry’s position on the alleged involvement of the Armed Forces (AF) ) Russia to attack the village of Groza. “The diplomat was harshly pointed out the unseemly role of the Czech Republic in the Ukrainian conflict, active support of Kyiv with the goal of “inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia,” pumping up the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) with weapons, contributing to the continuation of the conflict and destabilization of the entire region.” , - said the Russian Foreign Ministry. The department called the Czech Republic’s attempt to act as a champion of human rights and humanitarian values and turn a blind eye to the crimes of Ukraine untenable. Last minute tour: why Zelensky went to Bulgaria and the Czech Republic In Sofia, he argued with the president, in Prague he discussed a counter-offensive. Before this, on October 12, the Russian Ambassador to Prague, Alexander Zmeevsky, was summoned to the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Czech side voiced a set of claims and demands to Moscow in the context of a special military operation in Ukraine. On October 6, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov recalled that the Russian military does not strike civilian targets in Ukraine, but only military targets, places where military personnel gather and representatives of the military leadership. Russian military personnel began striking critical Ukrainian infrastructure facilities on October 10 last year. As Head of State Vladimir Putin noted then, this was a response to the terrorist actions of the Kyiv regime, in particular on the Crimean Bridge. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Putin announced on February 24 last year, continues. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"15 March 2023","Pope Francis expressed concern about the eviction of monks from the Kiev Pechersk Lavra and called on interested parties to respect places of religious worship. The pontiff made this statement on March 15 at the end of the general audience. “I think about the Orthodox monks of the Kyiv Lavra. “I ask the parties involved in the <Ukrainian conflict> to respect religious places,” the pope noted. The pontiff emphasized that clergy and monks always remain the support of “God’s people,” regardless of what denomination they belong to. It is difficult to be with God: monks are expelled from the main monastery of Ukraine. In the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra they are talking about the beginning of the apocalypse. Earlier, on March 14, the Minister of Culture of Ukraine Alexander Tkachenko said that the monks of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) can remain in the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra if will move to the schismatic Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU). Tkachenko added that, despite the statements of the monastery’s governor, Metropolitan Paul, that the monks will not move to the OCU and vacate the premises, “the situation may change radically” after the leadership of the UOC leaves the monastery. On the same day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sent letters to UN Secretary General António Guterres and North Macedonian Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani, as the current OSCE Chairman, in which he called for preventing the eviction of monks from the Kiev Pechersk Lavra and to stop repressions against the canonical Orthodox Church in Ukraine. On March 10, it became known that monks of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra must leave the monastery before March 29 of this year. The document says that an interdepartmental working group for preparing proposals and recommendations for organizing the implementation of certain tasks that are related to the activities of religious organizations in Ukraine, convicted the monastery of allegedly violating the terms of the agreement on the use of buildings owned by the state. In 2022, the Ukrainian authorities intensified their actions, directed against the UOC. They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” Thus, in December 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) opened 50 criminal cases against priests of the UOC.

Also at midnight it became known about an air raid alert in the capital of Ukraine and the region. A confident tip: the Russian Armed Forces destroyed a large arsenal in Nikolaev. Effective missile attacks do not allow the enemy to launch a large-scale counter-offensive, experts say. Earlier on the same day, an air raid warning was announced in four regions of Ukraine.

"December 7 2023","The administration of US President Joe Biden lied about Russia's defeat in the Ukrainian conflict. This was stated by former Fox News TV host and journalist Tucker Carlson on December 6. He noted that Washington officials said that US military assistance would enable Ukraine to defeat Russia and “prevent the latter from invading the rest of Europe.” “Almost two years have passed, and it turned out that all this was not true. Ukraine will not beat Russia. If anyone was beaten, it was the United States,” he said in a video posted on the social network X (formerly Twitter). At the same time, Carlson emphasized that the White House administration will never admit that helping Kyiv was a mistake. Well, help: American aid to Ukraine will be revised. The form of support and its content will change, and the amounts will become smaller. Earlier that day, a bill to provide the next aid package to Ukraine did not pass a vote in the US Senate. Also on this day, US President Joe Biden said that Congress must urgently approve a request for funds for Ukraine. At the same time, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said that the United States was committed to long-term military support for Ukraine even in the face of a delay in the allocation of new aid to Kyiv. Austin noted that he expects Congress to quickly approve the administration's request for $50 billion in additional aid to Kyiv through the US industrial base. In his opinion, most of these funds will return through investments in the American labor market, as well as in the security of the country as a whole. On December 5, CNN political commentator Stephen Collinson noted that the unsuccessful counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has called into question further funding of the country from the United States, since the provision of Billions of dollars from American taxpayers are being sent to help Ukraine.

This was stated on Friday, December 15, by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Economic Relations of Hungary, Peter Szijjártó, in an interview with Mandiner magazine. “If, in preparation for real negotiations, Brussels wants to squeeze something into the negotiation framework that would cause us damage, then we will we will have to resort to the instrument of a hard veto,” Szijjártó said. He also noted that the decision to negotiate with Ukraine is “completely irrational.” And he emphasized that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban did not participate in its adoption. “We do not participate in this decision, do not take responsibility for it and exempt ourselves from its consequences,” Szijjártó said. You Magyars don’t know well: Hungary does not want to allocate money to Ukraine and accept it into the EU The SBU suspected Orban of collaborating with Russian intelligence services Earlier, on December 15, Hungary used its veto power, rejecting the financial assistance program for Ukraine, which included the provision of €50 billion until 2027 year.

"July 9 2023","Germany, at the July 11-12 NATO summit in Vilnius, will advocate delaying Ukraine's entry into the alliance due to concerns that immediate membership could lead to direct confrontation with Russia. The British newspaper The Daily Telegraph wrote about this on July 8, citing an unnamed source in NATO. “Berlin is unfriendly to the prospect of offering immediate membership. He wants there to be a process and time to develop guarantees (of security - Ed.) and thus effectively block membership,"" the source said. According to the source, Germany is against the Russian leadership ""potentially testing Article 5 » NATO Charter on Collective Defense. It is noted that the United States, Great Britain and a number of EU countries are developing a number of bilateral security guarantees, which they hope will help protect Kyiv in the absence of NATO membership. At the same time, a number of Eastern European leaders, including Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, believe that Ukraine at the summit in Vilnius should be provided with a road map for gaining membership in the alliance. Call and not offend: the West is thinking about how to properly refuse Ukraine. They don’t want to see the country as part of NATO. Earlier that day, Latvian Ambassador to Germany Alda Vanaga said that in the context of ongoing hostilities, Ukraine cannot become a NATO member. July 7, American Senator Rand Paul said that Ukraine's admission to the North Atlantic Alliance could lead to a war between the United States and Russia.

Earlier, on July 5, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Ukraine must carry out reforms and meet the relevant NATO standards, which are also observed by other countries, before it can be accepted into the alliance. The press secretary also emphasized that the United States to this day supports NATO's open door policy. At the same time, the head of the Bundestag Foreign Policy Committee from the Social Democratic Party of Germany, Michael Roth, suggested that the regions controlled by Kyiv should be accepted into NATO as soon as possible.

The North Atlantic Alliance also confirmed the decision to create a Ukraine-NATO council. The first meeting of the council will be held at the summit in Vilnius on July 12 at the level of heads of state.

His words were quoted by the publication “Insider UA” on December 18. Zaluzhny noted that the effectiveness of the mobilization of Ukrainian citizens was affected by the dismissal of regional military commissars. “They were professionals, they knew how to do it, but they don’t,” said the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They set the agenda: how a new stage of mobilization will take place in Ukraine. The Rada expands the rights of military registration and enlistment offices, conscripts kiss the “trees of freedom.” Earlier that day, the governor of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said that the Ukrainian authorities, as part of the mobilization, limited the travel of men outside the part of the region controlled by Kyiv. He noted that the men who remained there had practically no opportunity to go abroad. The day before, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Kirill Budanov, announced the continuation of forced mobilization in the country. At the same time, he noted that the effectiveness of “forcibly mobilized Ukrainians is almost zero” due to their lack of motivation. In turn, Saldo noted that Ukrainian military personnel are demotivated because they were forced into the army “at gunpoint” and sent to participate in military operations. He added that Ukrainians began to be caught in discos and gyms, and also taken away from school. Before this, on December 16, it was reported that “soft mobilization” had begun on the streets of Lvov. Employees of military registration and enlistment offices on the streets tell passers-by about the benefits of contract service, but they do not hand out summonses as part of this action. Martial law in Ukraine has been in effect since February 2022. At the same time, the country's President Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization.

"23 May 2023","President Vladimir Zelensky's position in Ukraine rests on the support of the West. Former Czech diplomat Petr Drulak stated this in an interview with Parliament. “Zelensky understands well: as soon as Western support for Ukraine weakens, he will be finished,” he explained. Drulak believes that Zelensky’s trips to European countries are attempts to gain time. The Ukrainian leader is trying to convince as many hesitant colleagues as possible that it is still advisable to sponsor him, the ex-diplomat noted. At the same time, according to Drulak, Washington is increasingly making it clear that Europe should be more actively involved in financial support for Kyiv. The Americans advised Zelensky to independently convince the Europeans, he suggested. The former diplomat emphasized that in the United States at this time a group of supporters of exiting the armed conflict with Russia was gaining strength. It’s not so funny anymore: how the image of Vladimir Zelensky in the West is changing New leaks of secret documents present the President of Ukraine in a different light Earlier, on May 17, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that Zelensky’s trip to the West is an attempt to revive interest in Ukraine. Head of the Russian delegation At talks in Vienna on military security and arms control, Konstantin Gavrilov noted on May 16 that Zelensky’s “arms tour” showed the readiness of the West, in particular Great Britain, to participate in the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. Former adviser to former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin 11 April said that Zelensky would have to resign if he did not change his course. He drew attention to the fact that Kyiv is hiding information about real losses in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, when in fact the situation is critical. The West has strengthened military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 year against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

"25 February 2024","Ukraine does not have sufficient finances to repay the debt to the West for the weapons provided. This opinion was expressed by political scientist Alexander Asafov in an interview with Lenta.ru on Saturday, February 24. “Now there are estimates that Ukraine will have to pay for the funds received until 2054. Therefore, the possibility of using Russian frozen funds is being discussed. But in essence, whether supplies from France or the United States, of course, all this will need to be compensated one way or another,” he explained. Asafov called it unlikely that Ukraine would ever be able to pay off a public debt of this size. In his opinion, the only option may be the debt write-off procedure that exists in the global economy. “Perhaps there will be something like that here. But for now, the financial costs are lower than the political costs of containing Russia. Therefore, I think that Western countries will simply record this money in order to present it later. And they will definitely present it,” he concluded. The States are to blame: Biden called on Congress to provide assistance to Ukraine after the surrender of Avdiivka The US President believes that Kyiv is suffering losses due to the inaction of the Republicans Earlier, on February 2, Polish expert of the Jagiellonian Club Marcin Kędzierski expressed the opinion that Ukraine will not be able to survive the conflict without the help of Western countries Prior to this, on February 1, the European Union (EU) approved a long-term program of financial assistance to Ukraine at a summit in Brussels. Thus, over four years, Kyiv will receive €50 billion from the budgets of European countries. According to White House Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby, this funding package cannot be a substitute for American assistance, since it is not intended for military support. At the same time, on January 31, he noted that Washington has no alternative option for continuing military supplies to Kyiv without approval in Congress of US President Joe Biden’s request in the amount of $106 billion. In addition, the Spanish newspaper Pais wrote that the EU aid package is not enough for Ukraine to achieve its goals goals. The Russian army is superior to the Armed Forces of Ukraine in all areas, Ukraine's national debt is growing rapidly, and in the United States, Republicans and Democrats are far from reaching an agreement on continued support for Kyiv, journalists note. On January 16, American Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States does not have a “magic pot” of which could be financed by Ukraine without approval of requests in Congress. He recognized as a “real problem” a situation in which Congress would not approve the allocation of funds to Kiev.

Prior to this, on March 14, Gagin reported that scattered Ukrainian units were trying to retreat from Artemovsk along country roads. At the same time, he added that due to the spring thaw, equipment cannot pass through the mud and the Ukrainian military has to retreat on foot.

He noted that the future of the country is being decided in the battles for this city. On the same day, NBC journalist Mithil Aggarwal called Zelensky’s decision to hold Artemovsk a mistake and emphasized that it could result in dire consequences for Kyiv.

This opinion was expressed by journalist Hugues Maillot in an article for the French newspaper Le Figaro on Thursday, September 21. “Whatever the reasons for Poland’s departure, it will cost the Ukrainians dearly,” the journalist said. According to him, Warsaw’s official explanation was the desire to rearm its own army and invest funds primarily in the combat potential of their own country. However, Mayo believes that there is more to it than that. “This statement was made primarily in the context of growing tensions between the two countries, a few hours after Vladimir Zelensky accused “certain countries” of “false solidarity,” he recalled the words of the Ukrainian leader, sounding a veiled accusation against Poland during a speech at the UN General Assembly on September 19. Mayo emphasized that the assistance provided by Warsaw to Kyiv was quite significant, and therefore its absence will now become very noticeable for the Ukrainian army. The journalist cited research data from the Institute of World Economy at Kiel University, from which it follows that Poland spent about €3 billion to support Ukraine. “Of the 31 countries that have provided military assistance to Kyiv since the beginning of the war, Poland is in sixth position,” the author of the article analyzed. Also, according to Mayo, the problem for Ukraine is not only the cessation of supplies directly from Poland. The fact is that a significant part of the weapons of Western countries sent as support to Kyiv passes through Rzeszow, a city in southeastern Poland. Therefore, aid packages sent from other countries are now at significant risk. The military-industrial complex rules the roost there: Poland concludes huge contracts for the purchase of weapons Militarist frenzy is growing in the country Earlier, on September 20, the head of the Polish government, Mateusz Morawiecki, announced a cessation of supplies of any weapons to Ukraine. He explained this decision by the desire to supply the Polish army with the most modern weapons, which would exclude the possibility of continuing to finance Kiev in parallel. Later, on September 21, the spokesman for the Polish government, Piotr Muller, explained that Poland would only send Ukraine previously agreed upon weapons supplies. At the same time, Muller emphasized that Kyiv has made a number of political statements that Warsaw does not accept at all. Commenting on the dispute between Ukraine and Poland, the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov noted that these disagreements are far from the last and that further conflicts are ahead. Russia is closely monitoring the development of the situation, he noted. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which Russian authorities announced on February 24, 2022 amid the worsening situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce support for Ukraine.

"December 6 2023","Ukraine received from the European Union (EU) 480 thousand shells in 2023 instead of the 1 million units promised by Brussels. This was reported by Reuters on Wednesday, December 6. The authors of the material recalled that the key initiative of the European Commission (EC) to accelerate the production of shells, providing for the placement of contracts through the European Defense Agency, allowed during this time to produce only 60 thousand ammunition for Kyiv. Main a share of supplies - about 300 thousand 155 mm shells and missiles for MLRS - were transferred to Kyiv from the existing stocks of European countries. Another 120 thousand were received under “other procurement schemes,” the agency indicated. In total, Kyiv received less than half of what Ukraine expected by March next year. “According to the EU, collectively these schemes allowed the production of about 480 thousand ammunition, which is less than half of the planned figure, with only four remaining until completion month,” the article notes. Austin Chondrosis: The US and Germany are reconsidering assistance to Ukraine Who might benefit from a truce in 2024 At the end of November, EC head Ursula von der Leyen admitted that the EU had not fulfilled its own plan to produce 1 million shells for Kyiv. Von der Leyen called on European industry to mobilize to focus on military production. At the same time, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, noted that the EU would not be able to fulfill its promises to supply Ukraine with a million shells by March 2024; it would take several additional months to achieve this volume. Western countries strengthened military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022. The decision to hold it was made by Russian President Vladimir Putin against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to the aggression of Ukrainian troops.

"March 2023","Former US President Donald Trump said that if he were re-elected as head of state, he could convince the countries of the European Union to increase military assistance to Ukraine in 10 minutes. He made this statement during the annual convention of American Conservatives in the DC metropolitan area on Saturday, March 4. Munich talk: what the West promised Kyiv at a conference in Germany And how does Washington know about China’s plans for Ukraine “You know, you can meet with all the other leaders [of the European Union], I know all of them or most of them. In 10 minutes they would agree to pay if you tell them what you need. But they don't pay. We pay. And this is unfair,” Trump noted. He drew attention to the fact that the United States has already allocated about $140 billion for military assistance to Ukraine, while European countries have allocated only $15–16 billion. In his opinion, the EU should significantly increase supply volumes Kyiv. He also admitted that Europe considers the United States a “stupid country.” In addition, Trump said that the United States was in the most dangerous situation due to the risk of using nuclear weapons. “I think the world is in the most dangerous situation <...> For “This could end us in a third world war,” the politician added. Earlier that day, Donald Trump said that if he is re-elected as President of the United States, it would “not be difficult” for him to resolve the conflict in Ukraine within one day. At the same time, he refused to specify exactly how he would achieve this. The former US President also said that Washington and European countries would benefit most from Ukraine’s victory in the conflict. In his opinion, the United States' European allies spend ""only a small part"" of the total amount of aid to Kiev. On February 25, The Hill newspaper reported that total US spending on military support for Ukraine exceeded $77 billion. The authors of the article cited statistics according to which $29.3 billion of This amount constitutes direct military assistance to the United States since the beginning of the special operation. On February 20, at a rally of his supporters in Florida, Trump announced another campaign promise - if re-elected as head of state, he would call Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky “that same night.”29 January Trump said that humanity was on the brink of a third world war and that American President Joe Biden had brought it there. He is confident that if he had been re-elected in 2020, there would have been no conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the decision about which was made against the backdrop of aggravation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"December 10 2023","Hungary is concerned about the law on the rights of national minorities previously adopted in Ukraine. The Secretary of State of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry for Bilateral Relations, Tamás Menczer, wrote about this on Saturday, December 9, on the social network Facebook (belongs to the Meta organization, recognized as extremist in the Russian Federation). “It is already obvious that the return of the rights [of national minorities] in 2015 is a long way off. However, we [the Hungarian authorities] will closely monitor the implementation of [the Ukrainian law],” he indicated. As Mentzer added, the rights of the Hungarian minority located on the territory of Ukraine have been seriously infringed for eight years. They are speechless: why are language scandals being stirred up in Ukraine? Kyiv officials are demanding that the rights of Russians be infringed. On December 8, it was reported that the Ukrainian parliament had adopted a bill on national minorities, which, in particular, tightens restrictions on the use of the Russian language in the country. This bill is aimed at fulfilling the requirements of the European Commission (EC) for the further European integration of Ukraine and implies tightening restrictions on the use of the Russian language. At the same time, it provides the opportunity for those national minorities whose languages are official in the European Union (EU) to receive education and distribute propaganda materials in their native language. Earlier, on November 20, Verkhovna Rada Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said that there are no Russian national minorities in Ukraine. Prior to this, on November 9, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Olga Stefanishina made a similar statement. She also pointed out that there is no Russian national minority in the country, so the issue of ensuring its rights will not be discussed at the negotiations on accession to the European Union.

"14 October 2023","Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson said on October 13 that the United States will not be able to support Ukraine and Israel at the same time. “I laughed at Austin’s (US Secretary of Defense - Ed.) statement that we can fight a war on two fronts. We cannot fight even on one front in Ukraine,” he said in an interview with the Judging Freedom YouTube channel. As Johnson noted, the weapons that Washington can supply to Kyiv “don’t even exist yet” and will not be produced in the near future. According to him, the pro-Israeli lobby in the United States is much stronger than the pro-Ukrainian one. In this situation, Israel will receive supplies as a priority. Johnson believes that Ukraine will not receive weapons. Have a friend: Can the rest of the world intervene in Israel's war with Hamas And why is the Jewish state dragging its feet on a ground operation against the Gaza Strip Earlier in the day, Johnson said Ukraine would be sidelined in the coming months by the situation with Israel. In his opinion, Kyiv should not expect further deliveries of weapons, since the United States now has more important “children,” and previous supplies, which were supposedly intended for Kyiv, somehow went to Hamas militants, and not to Ukrainian military personnel. Also, American journalist Stephen Gardner said , that the United States fears an attrition war on two fronts due to conflicts in Israel and Ukraine. The day before, former Pentagon analyst, Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski said that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict would accelerate the decline of American interest in Ukraine. On October 11, the Politico newspaper wrote that members of the House US representatives are skeptical about combining assistance to Ukraine and Israel as part of a request from the Washington administration. Congressmen are ready to send funds to Israel, but aid to Ukraine remains a source of controversy within their ranks. The day before, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky expressed fears that Western attention to the Ukrainian conflict could weaken due to an attack by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas on Israel. At the same time NBC noted that Washington is considering the possibility of tying aid to Israel and Ukraine into one bill. The decision to provide assistance will be made by Congress. NBC also cited the words of a US administration representative that some legislators are opposed to the allocation of additional funds to Kiev. Leading researcher at the Center for Security Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, political scientist Konstantin Blokhin expressed the opinion that if assistance to Israel and Ukraine is really “tied up,” then priority will be given to Israel , the United States will not do this 50/50. On the morning of October 7, the Palestinian Hamas movement subjected Israeli territory to massive rocket fire from the Gaza Strip, and also invaded the border areas in the south of the country. That same day, Israel began launching retaliatory strikes against targets in the Gaza Strip and later announced the start of Operation Iron Swords. In the following days, the IDF continued to launch strikes against the Gaza Strip and areas in southern Lebanon. Thus, on October 12, it was reported that Israeli troops attacked more than 3.6 thousand targets in the Gaza Strip, and about 6 thousand bombs were dropped on targets. On the night of October 13, the IDF attacked 750 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. According to the latest data, the number of Israeli casualties after the Hamas attack increased to 1.3 thousand people, and another 3.3 thousand were injured. The death toll of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip has risen to 1.9 thousand, with more than 7.6 thousand people injured. The Palestinians are trying to ensure that future borders between the two countries follow the lines that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967, with a possible exchange of territories . Palestine wants to create its own state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and make East Jerusalem its capital. Israel refuses to return to the 1967 borders and divide Jerusalem.

"September 2023","Complaints by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky about mobilization evaders are a worrying sign. This opinion was expressed by retired Bundeswehr colonel and military expert Wolfgang Richter, writes Die Welt. “Yes, of course, this is an alarming signal, but I think the experts have known about this for a long time. This shows that the image of Ukraine, united by patriotism, is only partly true,” he answered a question from journalists about whether the president’s public complaints are a signal of distress. Richter also emphasized that Kyiv’s statements are intended to some extent “put pressure” on West, but first of all this speaks of problems within the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). Lay low in Wabrzeźno: Ukraine has rushed to find draft dodgers It will be more difficult for Kyiv to return its citizens than it seems Earlier, on September 5, columnist Stephen Bryan, in an article for the Asia Times, said that due to significant losses at the front, Ukraine will turn to Europe with a request bring back Ukrainians of military age. According to the author, conflicts have already arisen in Poland and Moldova due to Kyiv’s attempts to take away men fit for military service. Prior to this, on August 1, a member of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Sergei Tsekov, told Izvestia that Ukrainians began to understand that they are fighting not for their freedom, but for the interests of other countries and individuals in Ukraine. This is how he reacted to the words of the country’s first deputy defense minister, Lieutenant General Alexander Pavlyuk, that the problem of evading mobilization has worsened in Ukraine. On August 26, the secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, Alexey Danilov, said that in Ukraine, most likely, an additional mobilization. Later, the country’s Ministry of Defense issued an order according to which even men with limited fitness for military service would be mobilized. At the end of February 2022, martial law was introduced in Ukraine. For the period of its validity, the departure of men from the country aged 18 to 60 years is prohibited. On July 27, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky extended the decree on general mobilization. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced this on February 1. “Last night, this morning we received a proposal and in the end we developed a verification mechanism that guarantees the reasonable use of funds, and received guarantees that Hungarian money will not end up in Ukraine. After long negotiations, we accepted this proposal,” he said in a video message. According to him, the EU summit came up with a decision according to which funding for Ukraine will be strictly controlled. This was one of Hungary’s conditions, Orban indicated. The head of government also assured that Hungary would not transfer weapons to Ukraine and was in favor of peace in the region. Authoritarian pressure: The EU abandons democracy because of Ukraine How Brussels is promoting economic assistance to Kyiv Earlier in the day, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said that all 27 leaders of EU member states at the summit in Brussels agreed to allocate an additional €50 billion as part of a support package for Ukraine from the unification budget. Reuters, citing two anonymous European diplomats, indicated that the European Union was forced to compromise with Hungary, which blocked aid until the last moment. Now the EU has agreed to discuss assistance to Kyiv annually and, if necessary, revise it after two years. The Prime Minister of Belgium, which chairs the alliance council, Alexander De Croo, announced before the start of an emergency meeting in Brussels that the aid package to Ukraine worth €50 billion from the EU will go towards weapons and salaries for teachers, so reaching a compromise is key. On January 30, Orban told Le Point that he was ready to make a joint decision with the other 26 EU countries on financing Ukraine at the unification summit on February 1, if it is guaranteed that the amount will be approved every year by unanimous consent basis. The Financial Times (FT), citing a document from the European Union, wrote on January 29 that the EU could sabotage the Hungarian economy if it continues to obstruct the allocation of aid to Ukraine. It is assumed that the levers of pressure can be the exchange rate of the Hungarian forint and the level of investment attractiveness of Hungary. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which began on February 24, 2022 due to the aggravation of the situation in the region as a result of Ukrainian shelling.

According to the portal, on May 9, any public events will be prohibited in Latvia with the exception of celebrations on the occasion of Europe Day. The bill was adopted in two readings at once on an urgent basis. We will not stand behind the price: Russian residents of Latvia protest against the “cancellation” of May 9. In the Baltic states they continue to struggle with the memory of the victory over fascism. Last April, the Latvian Seimas approved a bill that declares May 9 a national day of remembrance for those killed in Ukraine. Nevertheless, on May 9, residents of Riga came to the monument to the liberators of Riga to honor the memory of Soviet soldiers and lay flowers. The next day, employees of the municipal enterprise collected and removed the flowers with a bulldozer, which caused indignation among Latvians. Hundreds of citizens again brought flowers to the monument. On May 11, police officers completely blocked access to the monument. In 2021, the public wearing of St. George ribbons was banned in Latvia. At the same time, the Sejm approved amendments to the law on the safety of public entertainment and festive events by a majority vote. In particular, these amendments prohibit holding public events closer than 200 m from any monument to soldiers of the Soviet army.

"September 2 2023","Minefields have become a serious problem for the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) trying to break through Russian defenses. Business Insider columnist Chris Panella said this on Friday, September 1. According to him, Ukrainian troops need to provide themselves with a maneuver space of at least 16 km wide in order to protect Western equipment from artillery strikes of the Russian Armed Forces. This task is seriously complicated by extensive minefields and other obstacles. Explosive devices, anti-tank structures and deep trenches on the defense line block the passage of vehicles. Because of this, combat vehicles, of which Kyiv does not have many in its arsenal, find themselves in the most vulnerable position. Assault halt: Ukrainian Armed Forces are once again driven back from Verbovoy. The enemy has concentrated maximum combat-ready forces in the Zaporozhye direction, experts note.

Authoritarian pressure: The EU abandons democracy because of Ukraine How Brussels is promoting economic assistance to Kyiv At the same time, the statement following the summit clarifies that the condition for providing assistance to Ukraine will be Kiev’s compliance with democratic principles, including a multi-party parliamentary system and the rule of law, as well as respect to human rights, including the rights of minorities. The EU also intends to annually review the implementation plan for the assistance program to Ukraine. If necessary, the European Commission will be able to make changes to it in accordance with the new multi-year budget of the alliance.

The number of states that approved the allocation of €50 billion in aid to Ukraine included Hungary, which back in December 2023 refused to coordinate such an initiative. As the Prime Minister explained, the country's Minister Viktor Orban, this was influenced by the provision of guarantees from the European Union that funds from frozen Hungarian assets would not be allocated to support Kyiv. The Prime Minister added that another condition of Budapest was strict control of funding for Ukraine. According to him, at the EU summit it was possible to develop a verification mechanism that guarantees the reasonable use of funds. At the same time, the head of the Hungarian government assured that his country will not transfer weapons to Kyiv and is not going to participate in the conflict. Results of the EU summit on February 1 - comments from experts and officials personsAccording to Andrei Klimov, Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, the €50 billion allocated by the European Union for Ukraine will be stolen. In a conversation with Izvestia, the senator noted that the funds that enter the country are for the most part simply embezzled by the Ukrainian elites, often together with Kiev’s foreign partners. Klimov also indicated that the EU will not allocate money immediately, but over several years, that is in 2024, Ukraine will receive a maximum of €12.5 billion. These will mainly be loan funds that will increase the country’s public debt. First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs Svetlana Zhurova, in an interview with Izvestia, suggested that with the help of the Kyiv regime, the United States wants destroy the economy of the European Union. Abroad will not help: the EU does not want to connect Ukraine to its market. How the working class in Europe suffers because of the support of Kiev and why it does not need cheap grain. So she commented on the video message of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to the participants of the EU summit, in which he stated that the next The next step after the allocation of €50 billion should be the approval of additional funding from the European Peace Fund. The deputy noted that decisions on budget assistance to Kyiv are already being made “with difficulty”; EU countries have to tap into reserves. In this regard, she suggested that Washington could push Zelensky to continue to “bleed Europe”, forcing it to invest money in Ukraine “like in a bottomless barrel.” As political scientist Leonid Krutakov explained to Izvestia, in making decisions about financial assistance to Ukraine, the European Union is guided not by the needs of its own population, but by the requests of the United States. He noted that in the modern “Atlantic world” decisions are made across the Atlantic Ocean, and Brussels simply implements them. The allocation of €50 billion to Kyiv, according to the expert, will lead to an increase in the EU’s internal debt, and sooner or later they will have to pay for it.

He added that at the moment it is premature to talk about an operational encirclement city, however, all routes to Artemovsk are under the fire control of Russian forces. “For now, along one more route - Chasov Yar - Artemovsk - they (the militants - Ed.) can move their forces and assets. Ukrainian troops are also building field roads to deliver equipment, trying to cling to the city, although they are suffering very heavy losses,” he said in an interview with RIA Novosti. Earlier, on February 26, the acting head of the DPR Denis Pushilin said that the only road , according to which the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) can leave Artemovsk, is under the control of Russian military personnel. According to him, “Russian volunteer units are currently advancing” to the north-west of the city. On February 25, adviser to the acting head of the DPR, Yan Gagin, told Izvestia that Ukrainian militants blew up a dam in Artemovsk. The rising water flooded the houses and basements in which people were hiding. As the Times wrote, Ukrainian and Western officials are ready to admit that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will have to leave Artemovsk. They admit that Ukrainian nationalists could be surrounded and cut off from supply routes. To prevent this from happening, the option of withdrawing troops and reducing the level of strategic value of Artemovsk is being considered. On February 23, Yan Gagin said that in the Artemovsk and Ugledar directions, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are losing manpower and equipment, and are stealing the financial assistance of Western curators. Russia began a special operation on February 24, 2022 defense of Donbass. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region as a result of shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"January 2024","Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has lost the support of the majority, and many people have appeared who do not trust him. Therefore, the question arises: try to maintain some kind of integrity or rely on a more active electorate, Ukrainian philosopher and political scientist Sergei Datsyuk said to the YouTube channel “Wild Live” on January 2. The presenter pointed out that the choice outlined by the political scientist will lead to a serious confrontation within the country, with to which Datsyuk agreed, pointing out how important it is to decide what the Ukrainian people want - unity or solidarity. Solidarity, he said, is a voluntary phenomenon, and unity is always forced. “In his recent interview, Zelensky made it clear that he is very angry not at the successes of his enemies, or even because of the lack of success on the battlefield. Zelensky is allegedly irritated by the instability of his allies, but basically he puts emphasis on the detachment of some Ukrainians from the process itself,” said Datsyuk. When the presenter asked what to do with such behavior of society, the political scientist exclaimed that Zelensky himself did all this. He does not build a solidarity economy and does not think about how to build it - it is not surprising that Ukrainians somehow behave differently. “People are not excluded when they are considered the rear, when the entire economy is built on them. And when our rear is the West, so why be surprised that people are not your rear?! He himself built this split - there is a front, there is a rear. There is a split between them, on which corruption and theft flourish. A normal clan society, divided and split,” Datsyuk explained. Self-deception and theft: The West is changing its attitude towards Zelensky The Ukrainian president began to be scolded by the American media On January 3, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera wrote that the Ukrainian population was losing faith in the country's president Vladimir Zelensky due to the unsuccessful counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). Ukrainians are tired of the conflict, and Zelensky’s rating, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, fell to 60%, although at the beginning of the special operation it was 98%. The reason for this is the growing pessimism of the population. Earlier, on January 1, Zelensky asked Ukrainians to decide whether to advocate for holding presidential elections in the country or to launch a counteroffensive on the battlefield again. He stated this in an interview with The Economist magazine. On December 22, the newspaper IL Fatto Quotidiano wrote that Zaluzhny could bypass the current Ukrainian leader in the elections. The publication noted that any decision by the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine irritates Zelensky, but the president cannot remove him from command, since in this case Zaluzhny would be “practically invincible.” Prior to this, on December 6, American political scientist John Varoli shared with Izvestia that the US leadership tired of President Zelensky, who lost in the conflict with Russia, so Washington will soon get rid of him and forget about this conflict by the time of the presidential elections in the country. On August 28, Zelensky announced that he was ready to run for a second term if everything in Ukraine in 2024 elections will still take place. Zelensky was elected head of state in the spring of 2019. Ukraine has been under martial law since February 2022. Under him, presidential elections are prohibited, but if parliament supports the relevant legislative changes, elections are possible.

In March, the Prime Minister Great Britain Rishi Sunak called for the acceleration and strengthening of military assistance to Kyiv from Western countries. He noted the international response to the conflict in Ukraine and considered it a guarantee of “containing any country from launching an unprovoked attack.” Western countries increased military assistance to Ukraine, including intensifying the training of Ukrainian military personnel, after Russia began a special operation on February 24, 2022 defense of Donbass.

"16 September 2023","The European Union is beginning to understand that Russia will in any case fulfill the assigned tasks within the framework of the special operation. Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs Leonid Slutsky stated this on September 15. “The EU seems to be beginning to realize the inevitability of Russia’s victory in Ukraine and the defeat of not only the junta [of Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky, but also the collective West behind it,” wrote he is on his Telegram channel. In this way, the parliamentarian responded to an interview with Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolaku to Der Standard, who called for thinking about actions in the event of Kyiv’s capitulation.

On September 14, American political scientist Malek Dudakov named the situation in which the United States will negotiate with Ukraine. According to him, if the Ukrainian offensive completely fails, Washington may decide on the need for dialogue with the Russian Federation. If Ukraine manages to achieve at least some, at least tactical, successes on the battlefield, the conflict will be frozen.

"22 December 2023","Admitting a state like Ukraine to the European Union (EU) would undermine the union. This opinion was expressed by the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov on Friday, December 22, at a briefing. “Accepting a country like Ukraine, regardless of its territorial problems, into the EU would undermine the entire EU system. And sober heads understand this, that this will be a burden that the EU cannot lift, the EU will collapse,” he said. This is how he commented on the words of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who wondered whether the European Union plans to accept Ukraine into its membership along with new Russian regions. Peskov emphasized that the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, as well as the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions are an integral part of Russia. “We are talking about Russian regions, an integral part of the Russian Federation, with all the consequences for those who can lay claim to them,” he said. Arguing about the ongoing discussion in the EU regarding the admission of Kyiv to the union, Peskov noted that it simply camouflages the understanding in Europe of the problems that will follow the accession of Ukraine. “Indeed, there is a discussion going on there, but this is such a discussion in relation to many countries, we have been repeatedly and we continue to witness such a discussion. <...> Europeans camouflage their understanding of the seriousness of this problem with a fair amount of discussion; they are experts at this,” said the presidential press secretary. Bloc and negativity: They no longer want to see Ukraine in the European Union Who opposes the start of negotiations on Kyiv’s admission to the union The day before, Orban recommended that Brussels once again be convinced of the European Union’s readiness to accept Ukraine into the union, taking into account the current situation of the country. The Hungarian Prime Minister noted that the presence of serious problems in Ukraine in various areas will hinder the further development of the European Union if the country does become a new member state of the association. In addition, on December 20, Orban said that Ukraine’s accession to the EU will cost member states € 150–190 billion. According to him, if Kyiv is admitted to the EU, the EU economy will be crushed, because Ukraine will qualify for assistance in the amount that Central European countries, including Hungary, are currently receiving. Earlier, on December 13, the first deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma on International Affairs Alexey Chepa said that Ukraine’s accession to the EU “will tighten the noose around the country’s neck.” This is how he commented on Orban’s statement that the European Union would make a terrible mistake by accepting Ukraine into its membership, and Budapest was going to prevent this. In the same month, political scientist Dmitry Solonnikov, in a conversation with Izvestia, said that Ukraine’s accession to the EU is unrealistic due to the high cost of this measure for the budgets of European countries. President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky signed an application for the country to join the EU in February 2022. In June of the same year, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, announced that Ukraine had agreed on candidate status at the EU summit. In December of this year, the EU approved negotiations with Ukraine on joining the union.

In turn, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Crimean government and the permanent representative of the republic to the Russian presidential administration Georgy Muradov pointed out that Britain, after the delivery of missiles to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, risks becoming devastated. The Russian Foreign Ministry warned that London's transfer of Storm Shadow missiles to Kyiv could lead to a serious escalation. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of Russia's special operation to protect Donbass.

"10 March 2023","French President Emmanuel Macron called for everything possible to be done to prevent the conflict in Ukraine from developing into a global confrontation. He stated this on March 10 at a press conference with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. “From the first day of the conflict, we have been providing assistance to Ukraine and its people in the humanitarian, economic and military spheres. We will do everything to prevent this conflict from spreading throughout the world,” Macron said. “Vladimir Zelensky’s goal is to drag European nations into the conflict” MEP Thierry Mariani - about the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, the Nord Stream explosions and Macron’s African tour Earlier this day, French MEP Thierry Mariani said that the goal of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky - to drag the European peoples into the conflict.

Prior to this, on March 6, former adviser to the head of the Pentagon, Colonel Douglas McGregor, said that Western countries should not allow further escalation of relations with Russia. He emphasized that at the moment, Europe and the United States mistakenly believe that a military conflict is always something that happens in another country. At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly announced the escalation of the conflict due to the transfer of weapons to Ukraine by Western countries. Thus, on February 1, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, criticized Macron’s words that the supply of military aircraft to Kyiv would not cause an escalation of the conflict. She called the French leader’s statement absurd, and also expressed confidence that such statements would only increase the “indefatigable appetite of the Zelensky regime.” Prior to this, at the end of January, the American Spectator newspaper expressed the opinion that US President Joe Biden’s ignorance of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s position on the issue of arms supplies to Ukraine could lead to an escalation of the conflict and provoke a third world war. Western countries have increased military support for Ukraine against the backdrop of a special operation to protect Donbass, whose residents refused to recognize the results of the 2014 coup in Ukraine.

Secondary wave: VFU losses cast doubt on their possible offensive How the approach of the NATO summit in Vilnius affects the situation in the Northern Military District zone Earlier that day, military expert Vasily Dandykin told Izvestia that Ukrainian forces will try to achieve at least some result on the battlefield before NATO summit, - therefore, the Russian Armed Forces can expect a regrouping and offensive activity of the enemy.

American analyst James Jatras stated this on July 18. “Ukraine has nothing to do with it, and neither do the Ukrainians. They are simply consumables,” he said on the Redacted News program. American journalist Clayton Morris also agreed with his opinion. According to him, the West needs new ways to start a world war. Morris believes that NATO does not care about the situation in Ukraine; the country is being used as a pretext to provoke Russia. Private question: what Western PMCs are doing in Ukraine How such campaigns change the course of conflicts and how much money their customers spend on it Earlier that day, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said that the crisis in Ukraine is not among the issues affecting the key national interests of the United States. He pointed out that issues relating to Europe should be dealt with more by Europeans. The American Conservative columnist Andrew Bacevich pointed out that the United States is using Ukraine to achieve lost world dominance. Ukraine will serve as a template for the spread of American influence to other regions. Also, the First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, said that Ukraine has turned into a private military company of Western countries that are waging a proxy war against Russia. Prior to this, on June 24, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that through the efforts of Washington, London and their satellites, the Ukrainian crisis has acquired a global dimension.

"26 December 2023","Russia is moving toward victory in the conflict in Ukraine, and the initiative unconditionally passes to Moscow, Richard Barrons, a retired British general and veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said in an interview with The National newspaper on December 26. “The initiative in this war unconditionally passes to Russia. This is not the state of affairs that we expected at the beginning of the year, but this is an objective assessment today,” he said. The British military man also noted that 2023 was not without difficulties for Russian President Vladimir Putin, but the Russian leader now looks more calmer and more confident than at any time since February 2022. The reason for his confidence is that he is not losing this war, Barrons added. Meanwhile, Ukraine has failed to achieve even the minimum goals of its planned counteroffensive, and American and European policymakers are increasingly hesitant about the need for further assistance to Kyiv. According to the general, the key component of victory for each side will be the ability to produce a sufficient number of shells. According to him, even if the United States next year can produce about 600 thousand 155-mm shells, the European Union (EU) - 300 thousand, and the British BAE Systems - another 100 thousand, Russia will still produce more shells than the West, in a ratio of two to one. In addition, Western stocks are now being depleted due to the conflict in the Gaza Strip, and shells that should have been sent to Ukraine are now being used against the Palestinians, the military officer noted. So the situation is definitely “working in Russia’s favor,” and the Russian leader is in a pretty good position, he concluded. Barrons also mentioned another shortcoming of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Thus, the average age of Ukrainian military personnel in some units is 45 years, but to achieve success it is necessary to mobilize young people, he emphasized. At the same time, the general expressed bewilderment that the United States and the EU, with their much stronger economies, could not stop Russia’s success. “This is an absolute failure <…>. It’s our own fault because we didn’t mobilize industry in 2022-2023,” concluded Barrons, adding that if Putin manages to win, he could end up with an army twice as powerful and experienced as the one he started with. and this should “greatly agitate Europe.” “The counterattacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are almost over” How artillerymen are destroying enemy equipment in the Donetsk direction Earlier that day, a Ukrainian army serviceman said that Ukraine would not be able to win the conflict with Russia due to the “low quality of human resources.” He also expressed the opinion that the Armed Forces of Ukraine need youth, because otherwise Kyiv will not win. Meanwhile, the head of the Russian Ministry of Defense Sergei Shoigu said that day that Russia had completed the main task of the special operation for 2023, thwarting the Ukrainian counter-offensive. According to him, this was done thanks to effectively built defensive lines, the combat effectiveness of Russian troops, the reliability of equipment, as well as the skillful and decisive actions of the soldiers.

The authors of the material write that, faced with obstacles in Congress on the issue of aid to Ukraine, the administration of US President Joe Biden is “promoting the creation of joint ventures between American and Ukrainian weapons manufacturers.” As it notes, with “the Ukrainian offensive now stalled and little chance of a land offensive,” the goal will be “to create a credible enough threat through drones and long-range missiles to allow for meaningful negotiations with Russia at the end of next year.” year or in 2025.""

Before that, On December 17, former adviser to the head of the Pentagon, Colonel Douglas McGregor, said that the intransigence of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky regarding the need to begin negotiations with Russia instead of continuing military operations could completely exterminate the country’s population. He stressed that Zelensky needed billions to continue the conflict after a peace agreement was close. At the end of November, Russian President Vladimir Putin once again recalled that Moscow never abandoned peace talks on Ukraine. The head of state also emphasized that any military action is always a tragedy, and indicated that “we must think about how to stop this tragedy.” The last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul on March 29, 2022.

On March 26, the former Chief of the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces, General Jiří Šedivý, said that the Leopard tanks, which were sent to Ukraine as military assistance, do not have outstanding characteristics. “I think he definitely right. We have a moment when you begin to exaggerate the possibilities. But there is no need to downplay them - this is a serious tank, especially if you take vehicles of one of the modern modifications.

Dandykin noted that Russian tank crews and anti-tank crews studied all the places of the Leopards - where to hit, how to hit. “This also applies to VKS, helicopter pilots and attack aircraft. Of course, the presence of Leopards will to some extent complicate combat operations. But if they are going to send them on the offensive, it will be a triple risk of destruction. I have no doubt that this will happen. One way or another, those who send them and train Ukrainian crews understand this.

Business Insider reported this on Thursday, October 5, citing the words of the former director of the CIA's Russia analytical department, George Beebe. “There are more and more signs that he is right. “Ukraine is failing to cope with military conscription, its economy is sagging under the pressure of the conflict, and enthusiasm for maintaining a high level of aid to Ukraine is waning in both the United States and Europe,” he said. According to Beebe, if the US Congress comes to complete chaos, then aid to Kyiv will abruptly stop. This would be bad news for Ukraine, as well as for the prospects for ending the military conflict through negotiations, he noted. The Business Insider publication also notes that Putin’s bet on Western fatigue played a role. For example, the far-right faction of the Republican Party in the US House of Representatives not only opposed military aid, but also removed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his post. The Pentagon said it still had billions in pre-approved aid, but to some extent then the moment it ends. Business Insider also recalls the words of the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, who said that without the participation of the United States, financial and military assistance to Ukraine will not be enough. In addition, the publication adds that the United States is not the only country that shows fatigue with Ukraine. Last week, for example, Robert Fico's center-left Kurs - Social Democracy (Smer) party won elections in Slovakia, promising to end support for Ukraine, with which it shares a land border. And in Germany, for example, the far-right political movement is now actively gaining popularity the Alternative for Germany movement, which is accused of maintaining ties to Russia. Delay: EU foreign ministers did not agree on assistance to Kyiv Why the EU is going through a critical moment and how this will affect Ukraine Earlier, on October 5, Putin said that without military assistance from the West, Ukraine would last a week. He notes that a similar situation with arms stocks is developing in Europe, where politicians themselves say that they have supplied Ukraine with all the armored vehicles and ammunition that they could. On September 27, the Politico newspaper also wrote that Western countries are showing signs of a shortage of arms to transfer to Kyiv and more and more tired of the Ukrainian conflict. The publication cited as an example that intransigent Republicans in Washington oppose sending additional aid. That day, columnist Tom Mockaitis, in an article for The Hill, pointed out that more and more donors to Ukraine are saying they are tired of the conflict and more and more people are opposed to supporting the Ukrainian sides. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which has been carried out since February 24, 2022. The corresponding decision was made in connection with the aggravation of the situation in the region.

"March 2023","Russia's ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, rejected allegations that Beijing was providing military assistance to Moscow. He stated this on March 3 in an interview with Al Jazeera. Peace tour: what Wang Yi came to Russia with and what China wants to demonstrate to Europe “China officially declares that it does not provide us with military support. As far as I know, this is not happening <...> and there is no evidence that we are receiving weapons from China,” the diplomat said. According to him, Russia has a developed defense-industrial complex and does not need the supply of weapons from other countries Kelin noted that against this background, thoughts about Kyiv’s victory in the Ukrainian conflict are “simply an illusion.” Earlier, on February 28, American Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that China would face serious problems not only in relations with the United States, but also with other countries if Beijing will support Moscow in the conflict in Ukraine. He expressed hope that China will take these warnings seriously. On February 18, Blinken also noted that the United States is concerned about possible assistance from China to Russia in the conduct of military operations in Ukraine. In turn, the head of the office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC Central Committee) Wang Yi said on February 19 that the PRC will never resign itself to US pressure and threats against Russian-Chinese relations. In addition, on February 22, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin stressed that information about China’s supply of weapons to Russia is speculation NATO.

"March 2024","The conversation between Bundeswehr officers about the attack on the Crimean Bridge demonstrates the extreme situation that has developed in Germany. Kremlin official representative Dmitry Peskov announced this on March 6 during a speech at the Knowledge marathon. The first” on the sidelines of the World Youth Festival in Sirius. “This telephone conversation generally showed the completely outrageous situation that is happening in the country. Either the authorities there don’t know what the military is doing, or they, the authorities and the military, are doing something that could have very serious consequences for all Germans,” Peskov said. According to the Kremlin official representative, Russia does not want a war with Germany, but at the same time it does not want other states to plot to blow up something on its territory. The Russian Federation will not turn a blind eye to such conversations. At the same time, Peskov said that in Russia they love the Germans and Germany, it’s just that the time of wise politicians has passed, and this applies not only to Germany, but also to other Western countries. On the same day, official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova told a briefing that German Ambassador to the Russian Federation Alexander Lambsdorff did not deny the authenticity of the recording of a conversation between Bundeswehr officers about the attack on the Crimean Bridge, when the diplomat was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry on March 4. The Foreign Ministry announced a demarche to the ambassador, he stayed in the building for more than an hour, and then left without giving journalists any comments. “Scholz will have to remove Pistorius from office” Bundestag deputy Herold Otten talks about the scandal in the Bundeswehr, the arms lobby in Germany and the conflict between the Russian Federation and NATO. RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published on March 1 a full transcript of the discussion of high-ranking German officers about possible attacks on the Crimean Bridge with Taurus missiles. This conversation also included a discussion about the supply of these missiles to Ukraine. In a fragment of an audio recording from representatives of the German Air Force, officers discussed how many of these shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether such a strike would be effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on March 2 that the German authorities are engaged in investigation into the leak of a recording of a conversation between German officers and called this situation a “very serious problem.” Bild reported then that Graefe was to blame for the incident because he connected to the conversation from Singapore through an unsecured network, creating a threat to the security of the conversation. The Ukrainian side is attempting to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 of the year. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, as this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"31 December 2023","After the failures of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) in Kyiv, they recall the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin about readiness for negotiations, the French TV channel TVL reported on December 28. “In Ukraine, talk is beginning to circulate that Putin was ready for negotiations on restoring peace almost immediately after entering Russian troops. Ukrainians now realize that in two years they not only did not recapture Crimea and Donbass, but also lost much more - both territories and people. This makes them bitterly regret the decision not to comply with the Minsk agreements,” the program notes. Also, crisis resolution expert Hervé Caresse expressed the opinion that the political disagreements of the Ukrainian leadership in connection with the difficult situation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at the front are leading Ukraine to an internal explosion. In his opinion, at the moment Kyiv is confused because it cannot find ways to explain to the population the need for its army to retreat. Agenda for the Christmas tree: a new law on mobilization can incline Ukraine towards peace The authorities want to encourage people with disabilities, youth and refugees The day before, the adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, Mikhail Podolyak, said that Kyiv will never negotiate with Russia, but will present it with an ultimatum. In response to this, official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova noted that Russia has never submitted to ultimatums or blackmail and has always responded in the most serious manner to attempts to attack it. In turn, the head of the Zaporozhye public movement “We are together with Russia” Vladimir Rogov called Podolyak’s statement is nothing more than a provocation due to impotent anger. Rogov added that Podolyak voices instructions from Western intelligence services, trying to increase the degree of hatred and escalation of the conflict, gain time and draw more residents of the post-Ukrainian space into the “meat grinder” controlled by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. Earlier, on December 28, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Zelensky thinks in terms of war and does not seek to establish peace in his country. The minister recalled that in Ukraine there is still a ban on negotiations with Russia, which was established on September 30, 2022. Since then, the Kyiv administration has not made a single attempt to resolve the issue peacefully, the diplomat specified. Prior to this, on December 26, the American television channel CNBC noted that negotiations with Russia are inevitable if the West stops supporting Ukraine. On December 20, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov pointed out the lack of prerequisites for peace negotiations in Ukraine. He expressed the opinion that this topic is currently irrelevant. The last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul on March 29, 2022. They lasted about three hours. Later, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow. On October 4 of the same year, Zelensky put into effect the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of the country on the impossibility of holding negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"April 2023","On April 6, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said at a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State that weapons were flowing into the country from Ukraine. “Weapons just flowed from Ukraine to Russia, through Russia to us. Our border with Ukraine is tightly closed. Weapons went through Bryansk and other regions,” he noted. Also, according to the head of state, several caches of saboteurs from Ukraine were discovered in Belarus. “There are caches of weapons and explosives in Belarus and Russia. They come in and take it. This is how this situation happened in St. Petersburg,” added Lukashenko. Evil spirits: what is the danger of supplying Ukraine with shells with depleted uranium? And how Russia will respond to the use of weapons with a nuclear component. Former American mercenary John McIntyre reported on April 2 that Ukrainian militants are selling weapons received from the United States to criminals. In February, a member of the German parliament from the Alternative for Germany"" Steffen Cotre warned that weapons sent to Ukraine after the end of the conflict may end up with terrorists in other regions. In addition, in December last year, Russia's permanent representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya reported an increase in illegal supplies of weapons intended for Ukraine. According to him, smuggled equipment appears on the black market not only in Europe, but also in the Middle East and Africa. Western countries have increased the shipment of weapons and military equipment to Ukraine against the background of a special operation carried out by Russia to protect the Donbass. The decision to start it was made due to the aggravation of the situation in the region as a result of shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"February 2024","Recognizing Ukraine's defeat will lead to an awareness of NATO's vulnerability. Jose Fiori, a professor at the Institute of Economics at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, stated this on February 4. “The USA and England will never admit defeat and must continue to support the Ukrainian army, even knowing that there is no real possibility of victory. <...> Recognizing the fall of Ukraine will have many consequences, it will mean recognizing the vulnerability of NATO,” the portal El Destape quotes him as saying. According to Fiori, such a development of events will force the West to recognize four results: Russia’s leading position in the media space, confirmation of the strength of the Russian army , Moscow's ability to develop economic and diplomatic potential in Asia and the end of a world order based on Western leadership. Come tomorrow: why the topic of Ukraine's membership in NATO is still relevant Who and for what reasons is in favor of Kyiv's admission to the alliance On January 20, retired US Marine Corps intelligence officer and military analyst Scott Ritter said that it is unlikely that Western countries will be able to transfer such weapons to Ukraine, which will be able to turn the tide of hostilities in favor of Kiev, despite the desperate situation of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.

Russian President Vladimir Putin On January 16, he announced the complete and absolute failure of the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and pointed out that “if this continues, Ukrainian statehood may suffer an irreparable, very serious blow.” At the same time, he emphasized that the unreasonable policy of the current leadership of Ukraine led to such a development of the situation.

According to her, the Senate will “fail the vote” on a new aid package for Ukraine and Israel, since the Democrats chose to “throw out” the issue of strengthening the southern border and combating migration from the general bill. who was “super-principled” for the Republican Party. However, the parliamentarian said that Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., “has done us a very great disservice,” likely referring to his statement on Monday that “there is no way ""to reach an agreement with the Republicans on the border. ""Zelensky's participation in the closed briefing, according to my information, did not take place not because of this, but for a number of other reasons. But I think it’s for the better, knowing already the results of the vote,” Ustinova emphasized. Later, she published a message from the journalist of the American publication Punchbowl Andrew Desiderio that the Republican senators left the briefing, writing: “The answer to why Zelensky canceled speech at a briefing on Ukraine.” Well, help: American aid to Ukraine will be revised. The form of support and its content will change, and the amounts will become smaller. The leader of the Democratic majority in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, announced on December 5 that Zelensky at the last moment canceled his planned speech via video link to US senators. Zelensky’s appeal would be a request to approve financial assistance to the Kyiv regime.

The corresponding material was published on Wednesday, February 14, on the channel’s website. The publication agreed with the words of the diplomat that the front line in Ukraine is shifting to the west, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Kyiv authorities to find resources for their military machine. The Russian Federation, in turn, has survived Western sanctions, while its military-industrial complex (MIC) has all the production capabilities. “In general, this is true, <...> and this emphasizes the dangerous state of the Ukrainian military machine, given the doubts about the continuation American financial support,” the publication says.

"11 May 2023","Ukraine may lose a close ally in Europe after the elections in Slovakia. William Nattrass, a columnist for the British magazine The Spectator, wrote about this on Wednesday, May 10. “There is one party that is apparently strong enough to lead the government, and this is bad news for Ukraine and the EU. Leading the polls is the left-wing populist Social Democratic Party SMER, led by former Prime Minister Robert Fico, Slovakia's most controversial politician and a fierce critic of Western policies towards the fighting in Ukraine,” the article states. According to the author, Fico is criticized for his rhetoric about the possible involvement of Slovakia in the conflict to please the United States. Supporters of the politician believe that he conveys the position of a considerable number of residents of the country. The observer cited the example of the results of a survey in Slovakia, according to which half of the citizens want Russia to win in Ukraine. “Fico’s position certainly reflects the views of a significant part of the population of Slovakia,” Nattrass emphasized. The journalist added that Slovakia is an important transit and repair hub for the supply of Western military equipment to Ukraine. In addition, this state also has influence in the European Union in matters of the crisis associated with the excess of Ukrainian agricultural products.

The day before, Acting Minister of Agriculture of Slovakia Samuel Vlčan announced unacceptable pesticides in wheat imported from Ukraine, transiting through the country. He added that the grain can be burned, used in a biogas station, or processed for technical purposes. Prior to this, on April 24, the speaker of the National Council of Slovakia, Boris Kollar, said that he considers it irresponsible to now give Ukraine the hope of joining NATO.

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday, March 22. “The rate of expenditure on ammunition is higher than the current rate of production,” he said in an interview with The Guardian. Stoltenberg expressed the opinion that the US, UK, France, Germany and other Western states had to be prepared to support the Kiev regime with weapons, ammunition and spare parts for a long time. “The West has put a lot on its war against Russia” Lavrov summed up the activities of Russian diplomacy in 2022 Earlier, on March 21, in the annual report for 2022, Stoltenberg said that NATO was agreeing on new goals for the production of key types of weapons.

The press service of the Russian Embassy in the United States announced this on Thursday, September 7. “The administration’s decision to supply Kyiv with depleted uranium shells is an indicator of inhumanity.

They recalled that as a result of the explosion of ammunition, a mobile radioactive substance is formed a cloud, small particles of which settle in the human body and lead to many diseases. According to representatives of the embassy, the United States is engaged in self-deception, refusing to accept the failure of the Ukrainian counter-offensive, and is exposing the country’s civilian population to attack, using inhumane methods in the fight against the Russian Armed Forces.” The [US] administration is revealing its true face: it is deeply indifferent to both the present of Ukraine and the future of the republic and its European neighbors,” the Russian Embassy concluded.

On September 6, the Pentagon announced the transfer to Kyiv of shells with depleted uranium for Abrams tanks, which, as reported by the White House, will soon arrive at Ukraine. In total, the next package of military assistance from the United States amounted to $175 million. Commenting on the White House’s statements that the shells supplied to Ukraine do not pose a radioactive threat, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova once again recalled the toxicity of depleted uranium. According to her, in places where such ammunition was used, a multiple increase in the growth of cancer was recorded, which NATO soldiers themselves could see. According to Igor Nikulin, a member of the UN Commission on Chemical and Biological Weapons from 1998 to 2003, the purpose of supplying Kyiv with toxic shells is the desire of the United States to make uninhabitable part of the territory of Ukraine, which they consider lost - Donbass, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. Nikulin noted that such a strategy is a characteristic Anglo-Saxon practice. On the same day, Russia requested a meeting of the UN Security Council on September 12 on the issue of foreign arms supplies to Ukraine. According to the Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, such supplies have a negative impact on the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which has been carried out since February 24, 2022. The corresponding decision was made in connection with the aggravation of the situation in the region due to attacks by the Ukrainian military.

"March 2024","The German Ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, called the leaked conversation between Bundeswehr officers about the strike on the Crimean Bridge a “good lesson” and called for no apology for the security breaches that caused it. He said this on the BBC on March 6. “I think this is a good lesson for everyone: never use the Internet in a hotel if you want to make a secret call,” Berger said. Responding to criticism from the former British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace that Germany is “heavily penetrated by Russian intelligence” and is “neither safe nor calm,” the diplomat called his words “extremely unhelpful.” In addition, Berger accused Russia of publishing the call and called on the allies to focus on supplying Ukraine with sufficient amount of ammunition. “Scholz will have to remove Pistorius from office” Bundestag deputy Herold Otten - about the scandal in the Bundeswehr, the arms lobby in Germany and the conflict between the Russian Federation and NATO On March 1, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion of senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, which, according to her, took place on February 19. During the conversation, the military discussed the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine. In a fragment of an audio recording from representatives of the German Air Force, officers discussed how many such shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether such a strike would be effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force command Frank Graefe, the Bundeswehr BBC inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. Official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that the German Ambassador to In Moscow, Alexander Lambsdorff did not deny the authenticity of the recording. In turn, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the conversation a demonstration of the involvement of Western countries in the conflict in Ukraine. Peskov emphasized that the recording demonstrates the extreme situation that has developed in Germany. Moscow also hopes to get acquainted with the results of the investigation by the German authorities on this topic. The Ukrainian side is making attempts to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, as this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"12 June 2023","In just a few days, the Ukrainian army was able to lose 16 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, CNN reported on June 12. According to the material, the number of destroyed infantry fighting vehicles is 15% of the total amount of equipment of this model transferred to Kyiv. This vehicle is used primarily for transporting personnel into battle and provides fire support. However, defense industry analyst and ex-British Army officer Nicholas Drummond noted that such losses for the Ukrainian side are quite expected. “A necessary but expensive approach. I would like to see the use of armored vehicles accompanied by more artillery fire and combat aircraft. It’s impossible to make an omelette without breaking a few eggs,” he noted. From the world to the hryvnia: why the salaries of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel were cut The IMF demands to spend less on the Ukrainian army On June 9, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that in recent days there have been significant losses in Ukraine, exceeding the “classic” figure. According to him, it can be stated that all attempts at a counteroffensive have failed, but the Ukrainian troops still have offensive potential. Prior to this, on June 8, CNN indicated that the Ukrainian Armed Forces had suffered significant losses in manpower and heavy equipment over the past few days. Ukrainian militants faced stronger resistance from Russian troops than previously expected. Also, Bloomberg, citing a source in the EU, reported that the Ukrainian Armed Forces lost a significant amount of equipment this week during the offensive. A special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by the Russian President Vladimir Putin announced February 24, 2022, ongoing.

"June 14 2023","The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), Valery Zaluzhny, could have led the commission of sabotage on the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 (SP) gas pipelines. This was reported by the Politico newspaper on June 13. According to the publication, a small team of divers on a sailboat participated in the operation. It is noted that it was originally planned to blow up the pipelines back in June 2022, but then the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ plan failed. According to the Netherlands Broadcasting Corporation (NOS), the CIA called not to blow up the Nord Stream after a warning from the Military Intelligence Service of the Netherlands (MIVD) about the plans Kyiv. At the same time, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky should not have known anything about the impending sabotage, the source added. The investigation was not completed: the EU will not investigate sabotage at the joint venture Why the West is rejecting calls to start an international investigation into explosions on gas pipelines Earlier that day it became known that Washington in the summer of 2022 warned Kyiv against committing sabotage at Nord Stream. Thus, the US government issued a warning to the Kyiv authorities. It sounded “several months” before the terrorist attack. On June 10, Belgian media reported that the US CIA, some time after the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline explosions, notified Belgium of the “alleged role of Ukraine” in the terrorist attack. At the same time, a representative of the Belgian Ministry of Defense refused to give the media a comment about this. After this, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova ridiculed the Belgian media reports. According to the results of an investigation by the American journalist Seymour Hersh, published in early February, the United States was involved in the explosions on gas pipelines. Hersh claims that the gas pipelines were mined by American divers during the Baltops exercise in the Baltic Sea back in June last year, and the explosives were activated by the Norwegians. Leaks in the gas pipelines were discovered in September 2022. A representative of the Swedish seismic center, Björn Lund, said that two powerful underwater explosions were recorded in the area of pipeline leaks at the time of the emergency. After this, traces of explosives were found at the scene of the accident. Moscow called the incident an act of international terrorism, and also indicated that they did not consider it objective to conduct an investigation into the incident without the participation of specialists from Russia.

"July 2023","Kyiv did not live up to the expectations of Western countries, losing the armored vehicles supplied to it within a month. This was reported by columnist for the Berliner Zeitung newspaper Franz Becky on July 2. According to the journalist, the West supplied combat vehicles to Kyiv in the hope that the troops would achieve success with the help of these tanks and armored personnel carriers. However, as Becky noted, a month after the start of Kyiv’s counter-offensive, the countries became disillusioned. The columnist pointed out that Germany’s support for Ukraine “cost lives and money.” He clarified that Berlin had allocated a significant amount for military assistance to Kyiv by 2023 - about €5.5 billion, while in 2022 the support amounted to €2 billion, writes Gazeta.Ru. Reserve for battle: what long-range missiles Kyiv can get and how they can affect the course of a special military operation The head of the European Commission (EC) Ursula von der Leyen said on June 30 that the European Union (EU) has supplied Kyiv with more than 220 thousand units since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine ammunition and more than 2 thousand missiles. She clarified that the alliance is now on track to deliver the expected million shells over the next 12 months. In addition, she then added that in order to further support Kyiv, EU countries should increase their contributions. Earlier, on June 29, the Ministry for the Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied territories of Ukraine reported that international partners provided assistance to the country in the amount of €170 billion. Financial support from the United States amounted to €71 billion, the EU allocated €62 billion. Other countries and organizations provided €36 billion. Prior to this, on June 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin , commenting on the destruction of Western equipment by Russian forces, indicated that the Armed Forces (AF) of the Russian Federation destroyed 25–30% of military equipment. According to the head of state, Leopard tanks, like Bradley vehicles, burn well. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which the Russian authorities announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of the worsening situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"March 26 2023","Political scientist Andrei Koshkin assessed the chances of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He spoke on this topic in a conversation with Izvestia. “The United States, which created the conflict and is prolonging it, is now insisting on a meeting between Zelensky and Xi in order to continue the main line of prolonging the conflict,” the expert believes. He said that today in Europe China is showing the ability to build stable relations and is trying to resolve the conflict that the US has created around Ukraine. “China does not deny that they are ready to work, but whether the meeting will reach the level that Zelensky will meet with Xi Jinping is a question. Zelensky wants to slow down the process of rapprochement between China and Russia and push back the possibility of a peaceful settlement - this was set as a task for him in Washington,” Koshkin believes. Peace tour: what Wang Yi came to Russia with and what China wants to demonstrate to Europe Earlier, on March 25, the Financial Times newspaper, citing an EU official, reported that the European Union (EU) is pushing Chinese President Xi Jinping to negotiate with Zelensky. According to his information, the European Union wants China to interact not only with Russia, but also with Ukraine. Prior to this, on March 24, adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, Mikhail Podolyak, said that negotiations between Zelensky and Xi Jinping are planned, but there are certain difficulties in their organization because of China's position. Podolyak noted that Beijing, according to Kyiv, has not yet made it clear to itself what position it takes and whether it is ready to take on a peacekeeping mission. On March 13, US Presidential Assistant for National Security Jake Sullivan said that the United States is calling on Xi Jinping to direct contact with Zelensky. Sullivan believes that this would help balance Beijing's views on the Ukrainian crisis. On the same day, The Wall Street Journal wrote about Xi Jinping's intention to hold an online meeting with the Ukrainian president. It is expected that it will take place after the visit of the Chinese leader to Moscow. At the end of February, China presented its plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. Beijing called on all sides to stop fighting, “abandon the Cold War mentality” and begin peace talks. In addition, the PRC repeated the thesis that nuclear wars should not be waged, and also opposed attacks on nuclear power plants and nuclear facilities. Zelensky at the same time called the PRC’s proposals for resolving the Ukrainian crisis “not an action plan, but reflections on this topic.” .

"July 26 2023","Kyiv continues its repressive policy against canonical Orthodoxy, and is supported by Western countries. This was stated on July 26 by the First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky. This is how he commented on the refusal of the representative of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), Bishop Gideon, to speak at a meeting of the UN Security Council. He called such actions a “historic and extremely sad” moment for the Security Council and the world community as a whole. “Thus, Western delegations almost openly identified with the repressive policy of the Kyiv regime against canonical Orthodoxy,” the diplomat continued. Polyansky drew attention to the hypocrisy of the British presidency in UN Security Council. It was one of the authors of the Security Council resolution “on human brotherhood and religious tolerance.” “Your decision to block, using the prerogative of the Chairman of the Security Council, the participation of an Orthodox clergyman is a clear illustration of how London actually treats all these high ideals and how easily it is ready to sacrifice them for the sake of narrowly selfish, petty attempts to prick Russia,” the diplomat added. We will be judged: the abbot of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel was sent to a pre-trial detention center Under whose pressure was such a decision made and will the Metropolitan be allowed to take insulin into the detention center On the same day, Russia refused to speak at a meeting of the UN Security Council on the grain deal due to the exclusion of Bishop Gideon from the report about the oppression of the UOC in Ukraine. Polyansky noted that the Russian candidate fully complies with the criteria, but Great Britain blocked his speech. Earlier in July, Russia called for a UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine on July 26, in particular, on the topic of repression of the canonical UOC. At the same time, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Moscow would raise the issue of persecution of Metropolitan Pavel at the upcoming UN Security Council meeting on the topic of the UOC. On July 14, the Solomensky Court of Kyiv changed the measure of restraint for Metropolitan Pavel from house arrest to detention until August 14. This verdict is associated with the presentation of new charges to the clergyman that he doubted the “sovereignty of Ukraine” and denied “aggression” on the part of the Russian Federation. He faces imprisonment for up to eight years. Back in 2022, the Ukrainian authorities intensified actions directed against the UOC. They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” Thus, in December 2022, 50 criminal cases were opened against priests of the UOC.

"26 October 2023","The Kyiv authorities want to incite military conflicts in the Caucasus and Transnistria, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing on October 26. According to her, in Kyiv they want to open a “second front” directed against Moscow. “Secretary of the NSDC (National Security and Defense Council ) of Ukraine, Alexey Danilov, following [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky, who recently called on Georgia to begin similar military operations, addressed a similar call to the authorities of Moldova,” she said. According to Zakharova, the Ukrainian authorities are inciting war in the Caucasus and Transnistria. Also a diplomat believes that the upcoming Copenhagen format meeting on Ukraine, which will take place on October 28–29 in Malta, is counterproductive and has no prospects. If only there was no country: why is Moldova quarreling with Russia? Chisinau aims at a complete severance of relations. Earlier, on October 12, the director of the Tiraspol Institute of Socio-Political Research and Regional Development, Igor Shornikov, pointed out that the Moldovan authorities, with the support of the United States, are preparing for an armed conflict with RF. In his opinion, declaring Russia the main threat to the security of the republic, as well as the emphasis on strategic partnership with NATO, is an attempt to provide legal grounds for forceful actions against Russian peacekeepers in Transnistria. In addition, Zakharova, back in August, drew attention to the fact that the West continues to push Moldova to conflict with Russia. She noted that Moscow warned Chisinau about the catastrophic consequences of such actions. In her opinion, the country’s authorities “continue to persistently pull it towards the abyss in which neighboring Ukraine has already found itself.” Share: if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1595559'); } else { document.addEventListener('recommendationRunInit', function() { if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1595559'); } }); }",2023-10-26

The monastery was let down: the Ukrainian authorities again tried to seal the Kyiv Lavra. Armed police were brought into the territory of the monastery, but the believers defended the shrine. The day before, June 26, the Ukrainian authorities demanded that the canonical UOC officially declare its break with the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). The UOC is required to prepare statements of withdrawal from the episcopate, the Synod, synodal institutions, and commissions of the Inter-Council Presence, send them to bishops and clergy, and make these messages public. In addition, it is necessary to officially notify local Orthodox churches about this decision. On June 13, the economic court of Kyiv at a meeting denied the UOC the right to use two churches of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. The Lavra’s lawyer, Archpriest Nikita Chekman, emphasized that the UOC will appeal the court’s decision in order to achieve justice and restore the violated rights of parishioners. The Ministry of Culture of Ukraine in May announced the transfer of 16 buildings of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra to the use of a national historical and cultural reserve. In 2022, the Ukrainian authorities intensified actions directed against the UOC. They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” Thus, in December 2022, the SBU opened 50 criminal cases against priests of the UOC.

He recalled this event when speaking about peace negotiations in Ukraine on September 15 during a broadcast on Phoenix TV. “What does this mean for us today? That achieving peace requires patience, persistence, a willingness to compromise, and creativity. But the will to find pragmatic solutions is also required. Peace in the 17th century became possible only because an agreement was reached that not all points could be reached,” the head of the Ministry of Defense noted at a conference in Munster dedicated to the end of the Thirty Years’ War.

"February 8 2024","NATO countries do not consider themselves to be at war with Russia and do not seek confrontation with it. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote about this on February 7 in an article for The Wall Street Journal. “We do not consider ourselves to be at war with Russia and do not seek confrontation with Russia. We will resist any attempt to drag the North Atlantic Alliance into the field of the Ukrainian conflict,” he said on the pages of the newspaper. At the same time, the German Chancellor habitually frightened readers with the consequences of Ukraine’s loss, calling on the West to support Kyiv, maintain the integrity of NATO and reject Russia’s attempts to divide the Western bloc of countries. Chapter The German government noted that the European Union and its countries provided the largest financial assistance to Kyiv, investing more than $91 billion, followed by the United States and Germany. Germany's military support is second only to America's, as Scholz's government has allocated, purchased and delivered more than $30 billion worth of military equipment, including tanks, artillery and expensive air defense systems. “Despite our support, Ukraine may soon face serious shortage of weapons and ammunition. Some financial commitments have already been exhausted, while others need to be extended,” he warned. The German chancellor assured that the long-term consequences and cost of failing to confront Russia would “eclipse any investment” at present. It didn’t work out: a scandal erupted between Paris and Berlin over aid to Kyiv France reacted sharply to Germany’s reproaches for insufficient support for Ukraine On February 5, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz shared his opinion that at the moment it is not clear when the Ukrainian conflict might end. According to the politician, Europe should continue to support Ukraine as long as necessary. On January 9, the British The Telegraph wrote that Scholz was irritated by the small amount of assistance to Ukraine from the countries of the European Union (EU). He instructed European officials to draw up a list of weapons that each EU country plans to transfer to Kyiv, believing that in this way they could put pressure on France, Italy and Spain. It then became known that France reacted sharply to Scholz’s reproach that some EU countries They don’t help Ukraine enough. At the same time, according to the Kiel Institute of World Economy, Paris allocated only €0.5 billion to Kyiv, while Berlin - the entire €17 billion.

"28 December 2023","The question of the possible return to their homeland of Ukrainian citizens of mobilization age living in Estonia is quite complex. This was admitted on December 28 by Estonian Interior Minister Lauri Läänemets on the eve of the Christmas holidays. “It is important to clearly emphasize: as the Minister of Internal Affairs or the Estonian state, of course, there is no goal to start driving Ukrainian men of mobilization age living here to the front,” the head is quoted as saying Ministry of Internal Affairs portal Rus.err.ee. At the same time, Ukrainians living in Estonia are still citizens of their country, and if Ukraine decides to return them home through mobilization, then Tallinn will have to share information with Kiev about the location of such persons, Läänemets said. The head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs noted that currently Ukraine really needs the help of its citizens at the front, but international law does not allow Estonia to extradite foreigners of mobilization age. “This requires a separate agreement between countries and at least a decision at the government level. This is only the decision of the Ukrainian state: who, when and whether it is worth conscripting at all. Then there will be a separate discussion at the government level about how Estonia will behave in this matter and how it can help Ukraine,” the minister indicated. The minister believes that Ukrainians living in the country need to be given a clear signal that Estonia itself will not drive anyone away and will not work to send refugees to the front. Hole on the border: Kyiv intends to conscript Ukrainian refugees into the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Ukrainian authorities are looking for ways to return men liable for military service from Europe. Before this, on December 22, Läänemets said that Estonia is ready to search for and extradite to Ukraine Ukrainians of mobilization age who are in the Estonian state. He noted that Estonia had repeatedly wanted to conclude an agreement with Ukraine on the extradition of escaped men. On December 26, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers submitted to the Verkhovna Rada a new bill on mobilization in the country. According to the document, it is proposed to eliminate conscript service as a type, and transfer all conscripts to the reserves.

Plekhanov, military expert Andrei Koshkin. Earlier, The New York Times (NYT), citing sources, reported that CIA head William Burns made a secret visit to Ukraine on February 22. According to Koshkin, the purpose of the visit is to prepare Kyiv for the fact that 2024 will be a year of endurance, and it is necessary to prepare for this. “He is mainly trying to reassure the leadership of Kyiv that Washington has not abandoned, it is simply impossible to directly extract money from Ukraine and a lobbying plan is now being developed,” the political scientist added. Nevertheless, from Kyiv’s side, a certain distrust of Washington is visible, and therefore there are discrepancies between the joint tasks of the SBU and the CIA, the military expert noted. In turn, Burns is trying to convince the Ukrainian leadership that the United States will not “escape like from Afghanistan.” Small spool but long: the United States has run out of money and time for Ukraine What options does the Biden administration have to continue supporting Kyiv and what does the CIA have to do with it?

"January 24 2024","Biographer of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky Simon Shuster in his book The Showman described the life of the Ukrainian leader in a bunker in the first months after the start of the special operation. Excerpts from the book are published by The Daily Telegraph. The shelter, according to Shuster, is located under the residence of the Ukrainian president in Kyiv. The first nights in the bunker were the hardest for Zelensky: he slept on a narrow bed, ate stale bread, canned food and sweets. The Ukrainian leader was pale and complained of a lack of sunlight and fresh air, the biographer writes. His assistant recalls that he “looked like a walking corpse.” The president also slept little and woke up his subordinates at night, demanding to report to him on the military situation. “In those early days, I woke everyone up. I had no right to sleep until I found out what blows were delivered and where,” Zelensky’s words are quoted in the book. After a while, the bunker was equipped. Dumbbells, a barbell and a ping-pong table were placed there, where Zelensky practiced. He also organized screenings of Hollywood films with his subordinates. He was served scrambled eggs for breakfast, and his assistants began to be fed goulash and hot dogs. Sometimes during meals, the Ukrainian leader poured wine for himself and his entourage, even after the government introduced a ban on the sale of alcohol. “Zelensky and his team maintained a supply of alcohol even after how the government banned its sale, and from time to time he poured wine for assistants who joined him for a meal,” the book states.

The association’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that NATO member countries will take a unified position on Ukraine’s entry into the alliance at the summit, which will be held in Vilnius on July 11–12.

He said that in China’s plan, as in any other, nuances are important, but so far there is no opportunity for an appropriate discussion. The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out the high assessment on the Russian side of the PRC’s desire to contribute to resolving the conflict.

"March 2023","The popularity of Russian leader Vladimir Putin among American citizens is growing, while the ratings of current US President Joe Biden are only falling. This opinion was expressed by The American Thinker (AT) columnist Laura Wellington. An elephant, a donkey and an IOU: the United States has again reached the national debt ceiling. Democrats and Republicans are opening the trading season around the topic of the borrowing limit. According to the author of the article, in the eyes of the US population, Putin is increasingly appearing as a strong politician who is not indifferent to the fate of the state. It is noted that the change in public opinion is due not so much to the actions of the President of the Russian Federation, but to the distrust of Americans in their own administration. Wellington noted that sympathy for the leader of a country with which the United States has such a complex historical past indicates a serious crisis and the absolute failure of the authorities. In such conditions, people are desperately looking for a foothold, and such searches often lead to the most unexpected results. “Putin’s rise in popularity in American culture is not accidental.<...> We can thank our incompetent president and his equally incompetent team for this,” — the journalist concluded. Earlier, on March 1, retired CIA officer Philip Giraldi said that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s model of multipolarity seems to him more reasonable and fair than the world order imposed by the United States. Meanwhile, on February 27, Fox News channel host Brian Kilmade said, that the fall of US President Joe Biden on a plane in Poland symbolizes the country's domestic and foreign policy of the last two years. On February 21, former US President Donald Trump said that Biden, by continuing to support Ukraine, is pushing humanity towards a third world war. He accused the US President of systematically escalating the confrontation between Washington and Moscow, and also suggested that the current leader of the country had gone mad. Prior to this, on February 17, former CIA adviser James Rickards expressed the opinion that decisions taken by the US authorities could lead to the conflict on the territory of Ukraine will end in a terrible way. According to him, the administration of US President Joe Biden turned the Ukrainian conflict into an existential crisis for Washington and NATO, although Kyiv has never been of fundamental interest to Washington. However, as the former adviser noted, the threat of Kyiv leaving Russia’s sphere of influence is existential for Moscow, which I don't intend to give up.

The Ukrainian military is training in combat shooting on training tanks. According to the publication, heavy weapons exercises began on Friday. Ukrainian military personnel learn to operate tanks, perform tactical actions and undergo medical training. Ukrainian military personnel are also trained in the maintenance and repair of tanks. By the middle of the month, 31 Spiegel training tanks had already arrived at the Grafenwoehr base. Raise supplies: will Kyiv receive weapons for a counteroffensive? The 11th meeting of the contact group on Ukraine was held in Germany at the American Ramstein base. The Grafenwoehr training ground is known as the US Army garrison in Bavaria. The base is Washington's largest training complex in Europe. Earlier, on May 27, Newsweek magazine noted that, according to experts, after the West supplies tanks, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will face difficulties in matters of training, logistics and coordination of tank forces with other parts of the Armed Forces forces. Military personnel will have to integrate unfamiliar and complex systems, as well as take into account the characteristics of new tanks in changeable weather conditions, the publication said.

"19 November 2023","new Maidan in Ukraine could be caused by the failure of the country’s army at the front or a deterioration in the socio-economic situation of the population. This opinion was expressed by Ukrainian political scientist Kost Bondarenko on November 18. “Nobody knows what will happen if someone’s loud call is heard. Perhaps accusations of working for the Kremlin will no longer work. The impetus could be, for example, a serious deterioration of the situation at the front or a sharp deterioration in the socio-economic situation,” he said in an interview with the Ukrainian publication Strana.ua. Earlier, on November 17, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said that Kyiv’s intelligence and partners informed him about a certain operation “Maidan-3”, which the Russian Federation is allegedly preparing to carry out a coup in the country. Commenting on this, Bondarenko noted that Zelensky could have been proactive, announcing the risk of a new Maidan in advance. He pointed out that critical sentiment towards the current government is growing in the country. Self-deception and theft: The West is changing its attitude towards Zelensky The American media began to scold the Ukrainian president. In turn, political scientist Yuri Svetov, in a conversation with Izvestia on November 17, expressed the opinion that there cannot be a third Maidan in Ukraine, especially when carried out by pro-Russian forces. According to the expert, today it is difficult to imagine that in Ukrainian society there will be people who are ready to take to the streets demanding the resignation of the current president. Also, Deputy Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev jokingly stated that Zelensky, who stated that Moscow is allegedly preparing a plan “ Maidan-3"" by removing him from the post of head of state, ""confused all the cards"" for Russia, and therefore it will have to change its plans. At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that, judging by the wording, Kyiv itself considers the previous Maidans to be coups d’etat. The previous two political crises in Ukraine, called “Maidan,” took place in 2004 and 2013–2014. During them, the country's leadership changed.

"December 31 2023","The office of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky “fell into a trap” due to a new bill on tightening mobilization. This was stated on December 31 by Verkhovna Rada deputy Alexander Dubinsky, who is now in a Kiev pre-trial detention center on suspicion of treason. “As I predicted, the authorities fell into the trap they tried to set for [the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery] Zaluzhny, transferring responsibility for mobilization to him “, he wrote in his Telegram channel. As Dubinsky notes, the published bill led to a flurry of criticism towards the Ukrainian government and the country’s military leadership. According to him, even “situational partners of the authorities” opposed the document. As a result, it becomes obvious that Ukrainian society is not ready to raise the stakes through mass conscription. “On the one hand, tough mobilization is necessary to induce the US and EU to allocate money despite the failure of the counter-offensive; on the other hand, the plan to demonstrate readiness for tough mobilization crashed due to the mood of society and the reluctance of deputies to vote for it (they would simply be torn to pieces by the crowd),” the deputy explained the difficult situation for Zelensky. With fear and doubts: the West is not sure about the future of Ukraine The French President hinted at the fatigue of the United States and the EU from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict On December 25, the Ukrainian cabinet of ministers introduced a new bill on mobilization in the country to the Ukrainian parliament. According to the document, it is proposed to eliminate conscript service as a type, and transfer all conscripts to the reserves. In addition, it is proposed to remove the category of limited suitability for military service, and all those already recognized as limitedly fit for military service will be required to undergo a medical examination again. At the same time, Ukrainians who do not appear on the summons will temporarily not be able to travel abroad, carry out transactions with property and will lose all benefits and government services. Then the leadership of the Servant of the People party advised the Verkhovna Rada deputies not to comment on the project on mobilization in Ukraine. According to one deputy, the bill causes concern among many and he himself is also worried about his personal safety because of it. At the same time, deputy Dubinsky expressed the opinion that the mobilization bill was created as an attempt to please the West in order to receive additional assistance. Such measures on the part of the Kyiv administration should show that the country is doing everything possible to continue the fight and deserves help, he added. At the same time, on December 26, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny denied the words of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky about the number of those being mobilized in the country. The Ukrainian leader stated that the General Staff and the Commander-in-Chief offered him to mobilize 450-500 thousand people. Commenting on these words, Zaluzhny said on the Rada TV channel that the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not make a request for the mobilization of citizens indicating the specific number of people who want to be called up for military service. The mobilization in Ukraine is taking place against the backdrop of reports of growing disagreements between Zaluzhny and Zelensky. Thus, on December 22, ex-US intelligence officer Scott Ritter said that Zelensky could be removed and shot on the orders of Zaluzhny. He suggested that a coup would take place in Ukraine in January or February. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022.

The head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, later clarified that the new package will also affect companies that circumvent the imposed anti-Russian restrictions. Earlier, on February 9, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Alexander Grushko said that the Russian Federation will give a response to the 13th package of EU sanctions. He also said that the Russian leadership will take measures to minimize the impact of these sanctions.

"December 8 2023","The European Union (EU) is not ready and cannot accept Ukraine into the community for several reasons, but the most important of them is that it is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban stated this on December 8 in an interview with Le Point magazine. The politician said that he does not intend to contribute to the EU’s “bad decision” on Ukraine. At the same time, he noted that neither the Ukrainians themselves are now ready to become members of the European Union, nor the Europeans see them as full members of the community. “We know exactly what is happening in Ukraine. The European Commission's report that four of the seven preconditions have already been met is simply a lie. Ukraine is known to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world. It's just some kind of joke! We cannot decide to begin the negotiation process on accession,” the Prime Minister emphasized. In addition, he added, in the issue of Ukraine’s membership in the community, the economic aspect must be taken into account, since it is a large country with a significant agricultural sector. And if this sector is included in Europe's system, it will “destroy it the very next day,” Orbán noted. “Without transforming our system of agricultural subsidies, we will not be able to let them in. The consequences will be terrible,” the politician said. TV series and drums: why corruption scandals do not subside in Ukraine The Minister of Culture spoke about a “wave of misunderstanding” and resigned. Earlier on December 8, Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak announced that the Verkhovna Rada supported increasing the staff of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) by 300 people. The parliamentarian indicated that this requirement is one of Kyiv’s obligations to the European Union. Prior to this, on December 6, the ruling party of Hungary, Fides - Hungarian Civil Union, submitted a resolution to the country’s parliament calling on the government not to support negotiations on Ukraine’s accession to the EU, since for this there is no consensus among the EU member countries. On December 1, Orban advised the EU to first conclude a strategic partnership agreement with Ukraine and no earlier than 5-10 years later return to the conversation about admitting the country to the union. Prior to this, on November 29, the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that Kyiv has fulfilled almost all the requirements set by the European Union to begin negotiations on joining the association. For Ukraine, they consist of continuing the fight against corruption, as well as introducing reforms to protect the rights of national minorities. At the same time, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said that at this stage there is no agreement among the EU member states on the issue of Ukraine’s membership. In November, Maxim Chirkov, associate professor of the department of economic policy and economic measurements at the Institute of Economics and Finance of the State University of Management, told Izvestia that Ukraine’s accession to the EU will have an extremely negative impact on the economy of the union itself. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed an application for the country to join the EU in February 2022. In April of the same year, the Ukrainian side submitted to the union the completed second part of the questionnaire for obtaining candidate status.

The Ukrainian leader earlier, on May 8, signed a decree on celebrating Europe Day in the country on May 9. The Kyiv authorities explained that such a decision was made in order to strengthen the unity of the peoples of Europe. In addition, Zelensky proposed celebrating May 8 as the Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in World War II. After this, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that there are many people in Ukraine for whom May 9 is a sacred day. And for veterans who took part in the Great Patriotic War, as well as for their relatives and friends, this day will and will remain sacred, he added. State Duma deputy from the Crimean region Mikhail Sheremet, in turn, said that this decision of Zelensky is a betrayal of the Ukrainian people. He believes that Victory Day will definitely return to Ukraine in its usual format as soon as it is liberated from the power of the Nazis. On February 13, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine proposed canceling the celebration of March 8, Labor Day and Victory Day. Later, on February 16, the website of the President of Ukraine appeared an electronic petition demanding that the celebration of Victory Day on May 9 be preserved as a public holiday.

At the beginning of November last year, Polish carriers and farmers began to block automobile checkpoints on the border with Ukraine. Among their demands was the introduction of commercial permits for Ukrainian carriers and a limit on the number of Ukrainian heavy trucks entering Poland. Due to the protests at the border, huge queues of trucks arose and interruptions began in the delivery of some goods to Ukraine. On May 2, 2023, the European Commission banned the export of Ukrainian grain to five countries in Eastern Europe.

He noted that former President Petro Poroshenko will not receive approval. “There is now a Nazi regime in Kyiv, where opposition politicians are being killed” Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov on the search for an alternative to Zelensky, the situation in the Northern Military District zone and the possibility of negotiations On October 28, the United States called Zelensky’s refusal from peace negotiations fatal for the West. Former adviser to American President Ronald Reagan, Doug Bandow, wrote in a column for The American Conservative that Washington and European countries must insist on Kyiv's decision to negotiate with Moscow to achieve peace. He noted that Western countries are tired of the impasse that is destroying Ukraine, killing Ukrainians without an ultimate goal, and costing the West itself dearly. Prior to this, on October 27, former director of Russian affairs at the US National Security Council, Fiona Hill, told Foreign Policy magazine that Russian President Vladimir Putin knows that the conflict in Ukraine is developing in favor of Russia. She suggested that Western leaders were victims of inflated expectations about what the Ukrainian army was actually capable of during the counter-offensive. Putin said on October 18 that Ukraine needed to lift the decree banning negotiations if it wanted to begin the negotiation process. In Istanbul 29 On March 2022, the last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place. They lasted about three hours. Later, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow. On October 4 of the same year, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky put into effect the decision of the country's National Security and Defense Council on the impossibility of holding negotiations with Putin. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Putin announced on February 24 last year, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"15 February 2024","The reconstruction of Ukraine after the conflict with Russia will cost €453 billion, the European Commission (EC) announced on Thursday, February 15. “As of December 31, 2023, the total cost of reconstruction and recovery of Ukraine over the next decade will be $486 billion (€452, 8 billion),” says the relevant document. The assessment was jointly carried out by the government of Ukraine, the World Bank Group, the EC and the UN. According to the publication, a year ago the European Commission assumed that the restoration of Ukraine would cost €383 billion. Get a spin: the West has turned Ukraine into a testing ground for testing weapons How the United States and European countries make money by prolonging the conflict and the deaths of civilians Earlier, on February 12, First Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Rashid Nurgaliev said that Western countries are interested in the maximum destruction of the Ukrainian state. He noted that industrial giants are already lining up to receive government orders for the restoration of the country’s infrastructure. Prior to this, on February 8, the Russian Ambassador to France Alexei Meshkov said that Western countries are prolonging the conflict in Ukraine, as this is beneficial to their military-industrial complex. According to him, the latter’s demands are an incentive for Western governments to continue the clash and not look for peaceful solutions. On January 17, in a conversation with Izvestia, Svetlana Zhurova, First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, said that the United States is prolonging the conflict in Ukraine because of personal gain , in particular because of business. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military . However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce support for Ukraine.

"22 May 2023","Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Property, Land and Property Relations Sergei Gavrilov told Izvestia on May 22 that the West puts political interests above humanitarian goals. Thus, he commented on the reluctance of the European Union to reconnect Rosselkhozbank to the international SWIFT system as part of a grain deal. “Decisions on this The types of transactions are made taking into account many factors and circumstances. The fact that they are going to ignore one of the important demands for Russia actually indicates a lack of interest among Western countries in ensuring more stable conditions for the functioning of the world food market. The main victims will be the poorest countries in the world,” the deputy said. In his opinion, such actions will lead to poverty, and Western countries are also responsible for this. “In the West, political ambitions are placed above humanitarian goals. When deciding on a further extension of the grain deal, Russia will take this into account. The Russian parliament did everything to ensure the flawlessness and efficiency of this transaction in terms of unlocking both settlement and insurance mechanisms,” concluded Gavrilov. Grain tag: EU does not plan to reconnect Rosselkhozbank to SWIFT Could the West's reluctance to comply with Russian demands lead to the abandonment of the Istanbul agreements Earlier in the day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the European Union's reluctance to reconnect Rosselkhozbank to SWIFT complicates the implementation of the grain deal. The press secretary of the Russian President assured that contacts on the deal will continue, since the deal has been extended for two months. Peskov stressed that this is a short period and it will “end quite quickly.” The Black Sea Initiative was signed on July 22, 2022 in Istanbul. According to the document, safe sea corridors have been created for the export of Ukrainian grain from the ports of Odessa, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny. The agreement was extended twice - for 120 and 60 days. The second part of the deal is a Memorandum on promoting the promotion of Russian agricultural products and fertilizers to world markets. The world organization has committed itself to joining in the work to lift restrictions that prevent Russia from exporting its products and fertilizers.

"June 2023","Russia does not need to be encouraged to negotiate on Ukraine, since it has never blocked them. This was stated by official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova on Wednesday, June 7. During the briefing, she emphasized that the resumption of the negotiation process on the Ukrainian conflict today depends solely on Kyiv’s readiness for this. Negotiations are possible only taking into account the recognition of new geopolitical realities. “In the matter of resolving the Ukrainian crisis, it is important to understand that Russia does not need to be encouraged to negotiate, since it has never blocked them,” said the Foreign Ministry representative. In addition, the diplomat recalled that the Kiev regime himself prohibited negotiations with Russia at the legislative level. Zakharova also noted that the Russian side welcomes China’s readiness to play a positive role in resolving the conflict. According to her, as Russian President Vladimir Putin noted, many provisions from the peace plan proposed by the PRC are consonant with the Russian approach and can be taken as the basis for a peaceful settlement when they are ready for it, including in the West. “There are no significant prerequisites for negotiations now” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin on the prospects of involving the UN in resolving the Ukrainian crisis Earlier, on May 27, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Galuzin said that for the peace process, Ukraine must refuse to join NATO and the European Union. In addition, according to him, Kiev must recognize the new territorial realities that have emerged after the realization of people’s right to self-determination. In turn, the adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, Mikhail Podolyak, called the proposal of the Russian Foreign Ministry an unrealistic scenario. The last face-to-face round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine after the start of the special operation to protect Donbass took place on March 29, 2022 in Turkey.

"February 2 2024","Slovakia will send funds to the European Peace Fund to support Ukraine, provided that they are not used to supply weapons to Kyiv. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico told reporters in Brussels about this on Thursday, February 1, following the European Union (EU) summit on the allocation of an aid package to Ukraine. As Fico noted, Bratislava is not interested in continuing to supply the Kiev regime with weapons. “We [Slovakia] can clear mines, help in some other way, but these will be non-lethal means (of assistance to Ukraine - Ed.),” he pointed out. I have not impoverished you to love: Europe is thinking about how to help Ukraine France is balancing, Germany wants to spend more Earlier on the same day, the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, before the start of the EU summit on the allocation of an aid package to Ukraine, said that EU leaders should decide to expand funds European Peace Foundation for even more shells. The European diplomat warned that if the leaders do not approve an increase in the fund by a new €50 billion, “they will pay a higher price.” On January 31, Borrell, following a meeting of EU defense ministers in Brussels, announced that the European Union had transferred military aid to Ukraine worth € since February 2022 28 billion, in 2024 the EU intends to provide at least €21 billion for the same purposes. As the Politico newspaper noted, without the help of European countries in the amount of €50 billion, for the allocation of which the heads of government of European countries can vote on February 1, Ukraine will be unable to continue military actions or support the destroyed economy.

"21 February 2024","Statements by European countries about problems with the defense complex after the supply of weapons to Ukraine are made in order to “extract” money from the state budget. This opinion was expressed in a conversation with Izvestia on February 21 by Associate Professor of the Department of Political Analysis and Social-Psychological Processes of the Russian University of Economics. Plekhanov, Colonel Alexander Perendzhiev. The day before, the head of the Swedish army, Johnny Lindfors, said that Sweden could not replenish its arms reserves after supplies to Ukraine due to rising prices in the defense industry. Perendzhiev explained that such statements are made publicly in order to “extract” money from the country’s budget, justifying an increase in taxes. “Here we are not only stating the fact that reserves are running out, but we are also talking about the fact that public coverage of such problems is done in order to put pressure on, to shape the public opinion of both our country and the Western community as a whole in the right direction. If, suppose, taxes were increased, there would be no indignation either from society or from the authorities,” the expert believes. In his opinion, such statements in general should be considered from the point of view of the implementation of a business project called “help for Ukraine”, which is the responsibility of the collective West. Supplies are at a standstill: what critical weapons could Kyiv be left without? Reducing Western aid not only deprives Ukraine of the ability to attack, but also reduces its defense capabilities. Earlier, on January 23, Swedish MP Björn Söder announced the need to organize checks on the use of weapons transferred to Ukraine. He emphasized that Stockholm has been providing Kyiv with extensive military assistance since February 2022, which included everything from armor-piercing shells to the Archer artillery system. Later, in early February, that Germany had reached the limits of its capabilities in the production and supply of ammunition Ukraine, said Arne Collatz, a spokesman for the German Ministry of Defense. According to him, in Berlin, everything that could be done has already been exhausted, including in the context of industry. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by the President on February 24, 2022 Russia's Vladimir Putin after the aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

As the journalist noted, the expressed dissatisfaction with the alliance gave rise to talk that the national the leader, and not third countries or organizations, must bear responsibility for his people. “I think he has fewer friends, even if they haven’t said so directly,” said Anna van Densky. She also called the Ukrainian president a “capricious prima donna.” and pointed out that such behavior only alienates the Kiev regime from Western countries. Advice and dislike: how the first meeting in the Ukraine-NATO format ended and what security guarantees the G7 countries offered Kyiv. The day before, the head of the British Ministry of Defense Ben Wallace commented on Zelensky’s criticism of the alliance due to the lack of a specific time frame for Kyiv’s membership in NATO and called on Ukraine to thank the West instead of criticism for arms supplies. The US delegation was also angry because of the words of the Ukrainian leader regarding the uncertain language about inviting the country to NATO. It is specified that members of the US delegation “were furious.” Some NATO politicians said that Zelensky was thus trying to put pressure on the alliance members and gather more allies. On July 11, at the first meeting, members of the military-political bloc published a communiqué in which the allies decided that they would invite Ukraine when they reached unanimity on this issue, and the conditions will become suitable. Thus, the summit document does not reflect either the schedule or the date of Kyiv’s entry into the alliance. On September 30, 2022, Ukraine submitted an application to join NATO on an accelerated basis. Then Vladimir Zelensky said that in fact Ukraine is already in NATO and meets the standards of the alliance.

On January 20, it was reported that some NATO member countries may privately send their troops to Ukraine. As indicated, currently among NATO countries there are those that can, outside the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, send their military forces to the territory of the Kiev regime.

This was stated on Thursday, April 20, by the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, commenting on the statement of South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol on military assistance to the Kyiv regime. “Such steps will have an extremely negative impact on bilateral relations with those states that are taking them, and will be taken into account when formation of Russian positions on issues affecting the fundamental security interests of the respective countries. In the case of the Republic of Korea, we could talk about approaches to resolving the situation on the Korean Peninsula,” Zakharova said in a statement. The diplomat also recalled that the Russian Armed Forces strike only at military targets, and not against civilian infrastructure. In addition, the “collective West,” including Seoul, chose to ignore the terror of the civilian population of Donbass, which Ukrainian radicals have been engaged in since 2014. NATO decided: the alliance announced new arms supplies to Kyiv Do the countries of the bloc have weapons capable of turning the tide, and how do such decisions affect the prospects of the negotiation process?

We want its sovereignty to be respected. We want there to be no Russian military in Ukraine,” he said, noting Washington’s desired options for the development of events. According to Kirby, the armed conflict will end if Russian forces withdraw from territories that the American authorities consider Ukrainian.

In a conversation with presenter Yanina Sokolova, he also expressed a desire to work with him on the same team. Such statements come against the backdrop of Zaluzhny’s admission on November 1 that Ukrainian troops cannot achieve a breakthrough because the conflict has reached a dead end. Delaying hostilities carries great risks for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, he said. His statements were criticized by Zelensky, which was considered to indicate a split between the military and civilian leadership of the country.

On September 29, representatives of the Republican Party predicted a two-week shutdown in the government. It was noted that if a shutdown is announced, more than 820 thousand federal employees will be sent on unpaid leave, that is, they will not be able to go to another job, and wages will not be transferred. At the same time, preparations for a possible suspension began on September 23. Earlier, on September 28, American political scientist Malek Dudakov told Izvestia that the suspension of the US government would lead to a reduction in aid to Ukraine. In his opinion, US President Joe Biden has no way to avoid a shutdown - this process will happen automatically on October 1. However, as the Americanist noted, this will not lead to any immediate disaster for the American government. Biden on September 24 called on members of the Republican Party to prevent a shutdown. He stressed that the government shutdown will affect everything from food security to children's education programs. The American leader called on Republicans to return to the budget issue.

"September 2023","The National Commission of Ukraine, which carries out state regulation in the fields of energy and utilities (NCREKU), demanded that Ukrenergo provide explanations for cases of receiving assistance from allied countries. This was reported on the official website of NEURC on Monday, September 4. “The Commission is concerned about the situation in which NPC Ukrenergo did not take measures to find reserves for frequency and power regulation in the UES of Ukraine by attracting additional sources of internal generation, including thermal, to cover the shortage of electrical energy,” the department said. The commission emphasized that they were referring to the balancing of the United Energy System of Ukraine in July-August, when NPC Ukrenergo regularly resorted to the help of foreign partners, instead of developing and debugging its systems. The department also reminded that the company can resort to help from other countries. But such extreme measures were permissible only when an emergency operation mode or a system emergency mode was declared.

The German newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau reported this on Friday, March 31. “We call on the German Chancellor, together with France, in particular, to involve Brazil, China, India and Indonesia in mediation in order to quickly achieve a truce. This would be a necessary step to stop the killing and explore possibilities for peace. Only then will it be possible to pave the way to a common security order in Europe,” the letter states. Among the authors of the appeal were trade unionists, as well as the son of ex-Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany Willy Brandt and ex-chairman of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse. They argue that peace can only be concluded on the basis of international law and together with Russia. In addition, the authors of the letter recall the growing danger of an escalation of hostilities, which could lead to a nuclear threat.

"16 June 2023","Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky does not believe in the ability of former American leader Donald Trump to stop the conflict in 24 hours. He stated this on Thursday, June 15, in an interview with NBC News. In his opinion, there are no people in the world now who could easily end the conflict. In addition, Zelensky commented on the statement of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who downplayed the significance of what was happening to “ territorial dispute."" The President of Ukraine responded to this by saying that the United States would be directly drawn into a “further conflict” if Russia wins. Zelensky also admitted that consideration by American politicians of reducing military assistance to Ukraine could become a “big risk” for the state, but expressed hope that this would not happen will happen. Two steps back: how the rhetoric about the Ukrainian crisis is changing in the United States American political elites have different views on the future of the conflict Earlier, on April 22, Donald Trump promised that if he wins the 2024 elections, he will have time to resolve the conflict in Ukraine before his inauguration. In addition, , in March the ex-president said that the Ukrainian geopolitical crisis must be resolved “right now.” He emphasized that he was ready to achieve a settlement in just 24 hours, but did not disclose the details of his plan.

"27 June 2023","The artillery supplied by Western countries to Ukraine is increasingly failing, and the Ukrainian army's ammunition reserves are running low. This is stated in the Foreign Policy material published on Monday, June 26. In this regard, supporters of the supply of cluster munitions to Kyiv in the United States intend to convince the administration of the country's President Joe Biden of the need to send these shells to Ukraine. The article states that in this way Washington could provide assistance to Kyiv faster and more efficiently, and, accordingly, the problem with Ukrainian artillery would be solved. Along with this, ex-special adviser to the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Dan Rice said that the use of cluster munitions would allow use much smaller quantities of them due to the fact that they are consumed more slowly. But at the same time, the material provides an expert opinion, according to which the use of cluster munitions poses great risks for the civilian population: the shells randomly scatter to the sides, and civilians may simply not notice them. Other experts say the supply of these types of weapons would undermine international arms control regimes, including the Convention on Cluster Munitions. Removed from storage: Russian Aerospace Forces destroy VFU ammunition depots Intense missile strikes prevent VFU from concentrating forces for a counter-offensive, experts say On June 24, the Politico newspaper, citing an American official, reported that the United States had not made a decision to send DPICM cluster munitions to Ukraine. However, along with this, Laura Cooper, deputy assistant to the head of the Pentagon for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, said that cluster munitions could affect the situation on the battlefield from the Ukrainian counter-offensive. It is known that the final decision on the supply of cluster munitions depends on two factors - on the restrictions on transfer of such munitions imposed by Congress, as well as from the possible reaction of the allies of the United States and Ukraine, which signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions. Cluster munitions are charges filled with a large number of explosive submunitions for various purposes, including anti-tank, anti-personnel, incendiary and others. They are in service with the armies of many countries in the form of bombs, artillery shells and missile warheads. They are also called dual-use ammunition and are currently banned in many European countries. The Convention on Cluster Munitions mentioned above is an international treaty that prohibits the use, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions. Came into force on August 1, 2010, it was signed by 123 countries, but ratified by only 110. Of the European countries, both Russia and Ukraine did not sign the convention.

"17 September 2023","The United States could lose a large-scale war due to a shortage of ammunition and weapons; shells may only last for a few weeks. Cori Sheik, a columnist for the American magazine The Atlantic, reported this on September 16. “Our country could well have lost a large-scale war due to a lack of weapons and ammunition, and not because of assistance to Ukraine. In a major conflict, the United States would run out of ammunition in a few weeks, and some of the most important categories [of weapons] in less than a week,” she writes. According to the journalist, the amount of weapons that Washington supplies to Ukraine is “insignificant” compared to the amount , which the country needs and which the United States does not have in reserves. Sheik emphasizes that Washington cannot rely on the fact that in the event of such a conflict, the allies will be able to provide for themselves or will develop a Lend-Lease program to send American weapons if they themselves are not directly involved in the conflict. “For example, even before the British Army began sending weapons to Ukraine, its stockpiles were so meager that in the event of a major war its ammunition would run out within a week,” the observer writes. She believes that the current defense The country's budget provides for expenditures of $109 billion on non-defense items. In her opinion, government politicians like to announce an increase in defense spending, but they are not focused on basic types of weapons and ammunition. Sheik believes that stopping the provision of military aid to Ukraine will not change the situation. “We need to dramatically increase our spending and speed up defense production.” “, she concludes. “We will supply weapons until the United States decides that the game is over” Member of the British Parliament Lord Richard Balfe - on the confrontation with Russia, assistance to Ukraine, the consequences of Brexit and elections in the kingdom Earlier, on September 12, the White House said that the U.S. have already spent almost $111 billion on the Ukrainian conflict.

"17 December 2023","For a number of reasons, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky cannot recognize the difficult situation of the country’s military at the front, according to a December 16 publication on the website of the American television channel CNN. As noted, he “has to pretend that everything is not so bad.” If we admit that the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) are facing difficulties, this strengthens the argument of a number of US congressmen that there is no point in funding the loser. If Zelensky claims that Kyiv is winning, then why does he need additional help, the author of the article argues. This week, the American Congress asked Ukraine to name the final price and a specific, simple goal for continuing the conflict. Instead, Kyiv consistently pointed to past successes and goals for the future. As Zelensky explained during his visit to the United States, the Ukrainian Armed Forces regained small territories in a year, caused damage to Russia in the Black Sea, and have a combat plan for 2024. However, the President of Ukraine called it secret. The material argues that the most useful slogan for Kyiv should be how gloomy the front line is for it now: Russian troops are pushing back parts of Avdiivka. In addition, on the front line in Zaporozhye, where the counter-offensive was targeted but ultimately slow and did not bring results, Russian units have returned with renewed vigor, and defense is costly for Ukraine. The crossing of the Dnieper cost Kyiv enormous losses, supply routes for the Ukrainian Armed Forces are problematic, and the prospects are very vague. Earlier, on December 16, The Washington Post reported that during a visit to Washington, Zelensky became embroiled in bitter disagreements in US domestic politics. According to the publication, Kyiv now has too much at stake for its president to remain neutral. The promised two years are being squeezed: Ukraine is losing US support. What Zelensky and Biden talked about in Washington. Before that, on December 14, the coordinator of strategic communications of the White House National Security Council, John Kirby, reproached the Republicans for leaving Ukraine without help, going on New Year's holidays and leaving uncoordinated request for a new military aid package. While the Ukrainian military is on the battlefield, he added. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by the Russian President on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"27 September 2023","Former American leader Donald Trump, if he returns to the presidency of the United States, will be able to reduce the scale of sanctions against Russia and slow down the supply of weapons to Ukraine. This opinion was expressed by Financial Times (FT) columnist Janan Ganesh on September 26. According to the expert, such a change in Washington’s position under Trump would fit into his “America First” concept, implemented by the politician during his first presidential term from 2017 to 2021 years. In modern realities, all this will lead to a decrease in American authority in the world community, which, according to Ganesh, has only strengthened due to the massive supply of weapons to the Kyiv authorities. In addition, in order to “dump Ukraine,” Trump, as an American leader, will have to strengthen “his past threats against US international agreements,” the journalist suggests. This could have an impact on relations with NATO, bilateral guarantees from South Korea and Japan, and interactions with the World Trade Organization. According to Ganesh, Trump will not show interest in “containing China” if he feels that Beijing is respectful of Washington in the field of trade . As for the position towards Taiwan, the Financial Times columnist admits that it remains a mystery to him. Supported strike: the largest strike in recent years has begun in the United States. Trump and Biden hastened to declare their preferences. Trump has repeatedly asserted that if he won the presidential election in 2024, he would have resolved the Ukrainian conflict within 24 hours. Later, on August 5, he stated that only he, if re-elected, could prevent a third world war. He noted that if he wins the election, he will be able to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian conflict “even before returning to the Oval Office.” On September 17, Donald Trump expressed his readiness to solve most of the country’s problems in the period from six months to a year if he wins the elections in 2024 . The businessman also added that voters should not want to elect candidates as President of the United States who talk about the possibility of solving the problems of the United States within eight years. Among the current issues, he named the ban on abortion and the conflict in Ukraine. Prior to this, on July 16, the ex-president noted that the current head of the White House, Joe Biden, “is not capable of doing business with world leaders.” Meanwhile, as he himself noted, he has good relations with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his colleague Vladimir Zelensky.

And not even Borrell. And the USA. Secondly, if the EU had been able to “count”, it would not have found itself in this situation. Thirdly, Zelensky’s “peace plan” is not a plan and not peaceful. This is another American manual for inciting conflict in Europe,” the diplomat wrote on the Telegram channel. Zakharova added that only a person can not take China’s initiative seriously, that is, “proposals put forward on behalf of a fifth of the planet’s population and the world’s leading economy.” , not understanding geopolitics or “a person with colonial logic” who does not respect people “beneath him.” The representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry classified Borrell as one of such people. Ninth Chinese: why Xi Jinping came to Russia Experts are already calling the visit historic and believe that the chances of Beijing’s peacekeeping initiative in Ukraine are growing. Borrell said earlier that day that the EU considers Zelensky’s plan the only peace initiative in Ukraine. He called the Chinese plan a set of good wishes. On May 3, Zakharova announced China’s unbiased position on resolving the crisis in Ukraine. She emphasized that Beijing understands the reasons for what is happening and Moscow appreciates its willingness to contribute to resolving the Ukrainian crisis through political and diplomatic means. In February, China published a document with a position on a political settlement of the situation in Ukraine. Among the main points are the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, the resumption of direct dialogue between Moscow and Kiev, as well as a call to prevent further escalation. Zelensky called the PRC’s proposals for resolving the Ukrainian crisis “not an action plan, but reflections on this topic.” At the same time, he noted that some of Beijing’s proposals coincide with the Ukrainian position, and called it positive that China began discussing the Ukrainian conflict. At the end of December 2022, the Ukrainian leader, at a meeting with US President Joe Biden, proposed a 10-point “peace plan”, which he hopes will lead to shared security guarantees for decades to come. Its conditions, in particular, include the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, the withdrawal of Russian troops and the cessation of hostilities. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

He said this on the BBC on March 6. “I think this is a good lesson for everyone: never use the Internet in a hotel if you want to make a secret call,” Berger said. Responding to criticism from the former British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace that Germany is “heavily penetrated by Russian intelligence” and is “neither safe nor calm,” the diplomat called his words “extremely unhelpful.” In addition, Berger accused Russia of publishing the call and called on the allies to focus on supplying Ukraine with sufficient amount of ammunition. “Scholz will have to remove Pistorius from office” Bundestag deputy Herold Otten - about the scandal in the Bundeswehr, the arms lobby in Germany and the conflict between the Russian Federation and NATO On March 1, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion of senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, which, according to her, took place on February 19.

The Ukrainian side is making attempts to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022.

Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, as this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"23 February 2024","President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky and Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen signed a bilateral agreement on joint work in the field of security. On February 23, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Igor Zhovkva announced this on Facebook (owned by Meta, which is recognized as extremist and banned in the Russian Federation). “Another agreement on the security of Ukraine. From now on with Denmark. Today in Lviv, the President of Ukraine and the Prime Minister of Denmark signed an agreement on cooperation in the field of security and long-term support between Ukraine and Denmark,” Zhovkva wrote. He also said that as part of the cooperation, Denmark will supply Ukraine with military assistance in the form of communications equipment, radars, drones and other equipment worth €1.8 billion. As for finances, the agreement provides for the allocation of €8.5 billion from the Danish Fund to support Ukraine, the issuance of this amount will stretch over 2023–2028. Zhovkva also added that after the expiration of the deadline the agreement can be extended by agreement of the parties and Denmark became the first state not from the G7 to sign such a document with Ukraine. Supplies are at a standstill: what critical weapons could Kyiv be left without? The reduction in Western aid not only deprives Ukraine of the ability to attack, but also reduces its defense capabilities. Earlier, on February 22, Frederiksen said that the Danish government had agreed on military assistance to Ukraine in the amount of 1.7 billion kroner ($247 million). She noted that time is not helping Ukraine and action is needed for its victory. Frederiksen promised on February 18 that Denmark would give Ukraine all its artillery, because the kingdom does not need this equipment. At the same time, she advised Ukraine to focus on servicing the equipment already at Kyiv’s disposal, rather than on producing new ones. On February 16, Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron signed an agreement on French security guarantees for Ukraine. Paris has promised to provide Kyiv with up to €3 billion in military aid in 2024. In addition, the agreement provides for the supply of military equipment to Ukraine, the training of soldiers and the strengthening of the Ukrainian defense-industrial complex. On the same day, Ukraine signed such an agreement with Germany. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised to allocate €15 billion in aid to Kyiv in 2024. The West strengthened support for Ukraine against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military. However, recently in Western countries there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce support for Kyiv.

"17 March 2023","European elites need to think about their financial situation, and not allocate new aid to Ukraine. The chairman of the State Duma Committee on Property, Land and Property Relations, Sergei Gavrilov, told Izvestia on March 17. This is how he responded to the information that the European Union (EU) next week plans to transfer the second tranche of macro-financial assistance to Ukraine for €1, 5 billion. “The day before yesterday there was a collapse in the shares of the largest Swiss bank Credit Suisse, and the European elites still need to think about their financial situation first of all in order to prevent the Great Depression,” the deputy said. According to Gavrilov, unlike the United States, where the collapse of three large banks shocked depositors, in Europe so far only shareholders and investors are suffering. “But in both Europe and the United States, the deposit insurance system is not designed for a prolonged crisis. If it goes deeper, the West will have no time for Ukraine. Since any closure and suspension of a bank’s activities is a blow to customers and, as a result, panic among them. And the maximum amount of compensation provided for by European legislation is €100 thousand for the accounts of one client in one bank. If a client has several accounts in the same bank, then he can only claim payment of €100 thousand - no more,” he said. The parliamentarian emphasized that deposit insurance is not enough for everyone. He explained that European commercial banks have a different deposit insurance scheme than savings banks. However, the amounts that these credit institutions hold for a rainy day cannot be overestimated. “For example, in German commercial banks less than 0.6% of deposits are insured. In other words: if a small or medium-sized bank goes bankrupt now, it will not immediately become a global problem in Europe. But if several medium or large banks close at the same time, then demanding compensation from them will be practically pointless. And in this case, clients will receive less than one hundredth of their money,” Gavrilov concluded. Tank audit: how the anniversary meeting in the Ramstein format ended And why this time there was no discussion of fighters The Macro-Financial Assistance Plus program in the form of preferential lending to Ukraine for 2023 is designed for €18 billion. The EU countries approved it on December 15, 2022. The President of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, noted then that the EU allocated €19.7 billion to Kyiv at the end of 2022 and will continue to support Ukraine “for as long as necessary.” The first tranche in the amount of €3 billion was transferred to Ukraine on January 17. At the same time, it was reported that the European Commission intends to transfer €1.5 billion monthly to Kyiv starting in March.

"January 25 2024","Lithuania's political elite, thanks to its unfounded militaristic rhetoric, paid for by taxpayers, may not be able to avoid public protests in the future. Political scientist Ivan Meziukho expressed this opinion in a conversation with Izvestia on January 25. Earlier on Thursday, Speaker of the Sejm (Parliament) of Lithuania Victoria Cmilyte-Nielsen said on national radio LRT that borrowing money to finance defense spending from the population is an acceptable option. As noted Mezyukho, the political establishment of Lithuania with such sentiments can “play out” to popular protests, despite the fact that a significant part of the working-age population is abroad to work, since this state has a low level of income. “Probably, if today the majority of Lithuanian citizens of working age was inside this state, then today the political elite of this country, thanks to its militarized rhetoric, for which taxpayers pay, simply would not have avoided public protests. I think that the spring of dissatisfaction with the fact that citizens have to pay for other people’s military actions will eventually burst,” the political scientist believes. He also added that their friendship with Ukraine is a temporary phenomenon and this should be understood both in Vilnius and in Kyiv. Loyal customers: Lithuania is spending more and more on weapons The country is buying products from the American military-industrial complex Prior to this, on January 19, the head of the Lithuanian Ministry of Economy Aušrine Armonaite also proposed borrowing money from citizens as one of the sources of financing the defense needs of the state. In her opinion, citizens of the country can “invest their savings in tanks.” Also on that day, Lithuanian resident Gitanas Nausėda said in an interview with El Mundo newspaper that Western Europe may feel tired of the conflict in Ukraine, but not on the eastern flank of NATO. Western countries strengthened military and financial support for Ukraine against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"July 2023","The Canadian government has condemned the use of cluster munitions after the US announced they would be transferred to Ukraine. This is stated in a statement published on July 8 by CTV News. “We do not support the use of cluster munitions and are committed to ending the impact of cluster munitions on civilians, especially children,” the statement says.

Reserve for battle: what long-range missiles Kyiv can get and how they can affect the course of a special military operation On July 7, US Presidential National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that Washington will transfer cluster munitions to Kyiv. According to him, Kyiv gave guarantees that they would be used responsibly. In turn, the Russian ambassador in Washington Anatoly Antonov called the decision to supply cluster munitions to Kiev a gesture of desperation on the part of the United States. Former US intelligence officer Scott Ritter said that supplying cluster munitions to Ukraine will make the army of this country less effective than when conventional high-explosive fragmentation shells were used. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the decision of which was made after the aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"14 June 2023","If former US head of state Donald Trump wins the presidential election in 2024, Hungary is counting on him to stop the conflict and ensure peace in Ukraine. The Hungarian Foreign Minister of Hungary, Peter Szijjártó, said this in an interview with the American television channel Newsmax TV. He added that the Ukrainian conflict might not have happened if Trump had been re-elected in 2020. “I’m quite sure - how sure can we be of what did not happen - that if President Trump had won the election, this war would not have started. And we look at his possible return to the White House as hope for a peaceful future,” the diplomat said.

"April 3 2023","Neo-Nazi activists are arriving at the location of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, mocking the attempts of the brethren and those praying to preserve the monastery as part of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). This statement was published by the Russian Foreign Ministry on Sunday, April 2, in its Telegram channel. The message indicated that such an action had been prepared for a long time. The Russian Foreign Ministry noted that pressure on the Lavra is carried out during Lent. The ministry also noted that the Zelensky administration is not independent in its anti-religious policy, and the split in Orthodoxy comes from Washington. “The United States has created a whole perverted mechanism of direct and indirect influence on the confessional side of the Kyiv politics: a “special representative for religious freedom” was appointed, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom is functioning, annual reports are regularly prepared,” the Foreign Ministry said. In addition, the message states that there was no reaction to the appeal of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to the UN Secretary General and to the OSCE Chairman in order to stop the demonstrative arbitrariness against the UOC. Other people's laurels do not give rest: why is Kyiv inciting a religious conflict? Dissenters are trying to lure away the monks of the UOC, nationalists are threatening violence. Earlier that day, it became known that one of the men who mocked a believer near the Kiev Pechersk Lavra was hospitalized without signs of life. The day before, it was reported that that a group of opponents of the UOC staged dances around a believer praying on her knees at the entrance to the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. The day before, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that in Ukraine, in front of the eyes of the whole world, “Orthodoxy is being raped,” while the entire “civilized West” continues remain silent and does not even try to defend human rights and religious freedom. Prior to this, on March 31, the permanent representative of Russia at the UN Geneva headquarters, Gennady Gatilov, reported that the rights of believers were being violated in Ukraine. On the same day, a group of radically minded citizens appeared in the territory Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. The nationalists shouted insults at the believers, provoking a crowd outside the walls of the monastery. The conflict between the Ukrainian authorities and the UOC developed after a warning was published on the monastery’s website on March 10 with the signature of the acting. General Director of the National Reserve ""Kievo-Pechersk Lavra"" Alexander Rudnik that the monks of the Lavra must leave the monastery before March 29, 2023.

On the day the Kyiv regime's ultimatum expired, hundreds of parishioners came to the temple. According to Izvestia, about 200 people gathered on the street near the temple. The reason for the closure of part of the monastery was allegedly identified violations. Last November, as a result of searches on the territory of the monastery, the Security Service of Ukraine found pro-Russian literature.

Earlier, on March 24, Ritter said that even deliveries of Abrams and Leopard would not affect the situation at the front, since Russia knows how to fight with such equipment. In September 2022, the director of the Alaska-based Center for Security and Arctic Resilience, Troy Bouffard, said that Russia's hypersonic missile program is frightening. He recalled that the Russian Federation and China are armed with supersonic missiles capable of traveling 6 thousand km/h at low altitude and also changing direction.

The publication also recalled that the Russian military destroyed a NASAMS battery made in Norway in the special operation zone.

This was stated on Wednesday, June 7, by the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova. “We drew attention to the recent initiatives of the Indonesian Minister of Defense [Prabowo Subianto].

This was reported on Tuesday, December 12, by Bloomberg journalist Jennifer Jacobs on her page on the social network X (formerly Twitter). “I asked Zelensky during a meeting in the Oval Office with [US President Joe] Biden whether he could defeat Russia without additional US assistance. Without giving an answer, he slightly shrugged his shoulder,” she said. The promise has been delayed for two years: Ukraine is losing US support. What Zelensky and Biden talked about in Washington.

"December 9 2023","Residents of Ukraine will easily forget about supporting nationalist ideas and repent of their mistakes after the end of the Ukrainian conflict. This was pointed out by Czech political commentator Stepan Kotrba in an interview with the newspaper Parlamentní listy, published on December 7. In his opinion, in Ukraine, in 20 years, no one will regret the death of fans of the leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN, banned in the Russian Federation) Stepan Bandera, of whom there are currently many in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). “Maybe even their surviving relatives. I even admit that they will be ashamed that they were so deceived,” the analyst emphasized. He also added that both in Ukraine and in the West, by now, few people doubt that the Kyiv regime has nothing to oppose to its weapons and economic superiority Russia. “Even the last fool in the West has already realized that Kyiv has nothing to oppose to Russian weapons and economic superiority. But Russia didn’t even send all its soldiers and all the equipment to the front,” Kotrba noted. He also pointed out that the Russian army takes good care of the civilian population of Ukraine, which will contribute to a positive attitude towards Russia after the completion of the special military operation (SVO) . Bloody harvest: why Ukrainian nationalists killed Poles and Belarusians The Volyn massacre, Trostenets, Ozarichi and Khatyn are not a complete list of places where Bandera’s followers committed their crimes. Earlier, at the end of November, the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov pointed out the flourishing of Nazi sentiments in Ukraine after the military coup in 2014. According to him, the overthrow of the legitimate government in Kyiv then brought a flourishing of first ultra-nationalist and then openly Nazi sentiments. Speaking about the spread of nationalist ideas in Ukraine, Chairman of the Russian Federation Council Valentina Matvienko in September called this country a sad example of cultural degradation. She pointed out that ancient Orthodox shrines there are currently being desecrated, monuments to great figures of the past are being dismantled, and their own history is being purposefully distorted, and “executioners and traitors are being exalted.” At the same time, political scientist Alexey Kochetkov, in a conversation with Izvestia, pointed out that in Ukraine For many years now, a revanchist, neo-Nazi narrative has been actively promoting, primarily associated with the revision of the results of the Second World War. According to him, the official ideology of modern Ukraine is Ukrainian integral nationalism, which was in service with the organization of Ukrainian nationalists during the Second World War. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also repeatedly spoken about nationalism in Ukraine. Thus, on September 5, the Russian leader said that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky was covering up the glorification of Nazism. Putin added that Zelensky, who is an ethnic Jew, was installed by Western countries to cover up the anti-human essence of the Kyiv regime. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which the Russian Federation announced on February 24 last year, continues. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"21 July 2023","More than 12 American Bradley infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) were destroyed in Ukraine. The Washington Post reported this on July 20, citing a source in the Pentagon. The corresponding information, as the publication notes, has already been confirmed by the Dutch project Oryx, which tracks losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). According to him, another two dozen American vehicles were seriously damaged. It is noted that some of the infantry fighting vehicles were returned to the front after repairs, and some were taken to Poland for serious restoration. As the newspaper points out, the large-scale losses of armored vehicles surprised the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is emphasized that the Bradley crew is very well protected; they often receive only minor injuries in the event of a vehicle being blown up by a mine. The newspaper’s source clarified that the Ukrainian Armed Forces militants were trained to use the Bradley as part of a strategy involving the interaction of infantry, aviation and armored vehicles. However, in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, not all commanders adhere to this doctrine of combat operations. Burning summer: The Ukrainian Armed Forces have already lost 311 tanks in attempts to attack. What other losses are Ukrainian formations suffering in the Northern Military District zone? Earlier, on July 19, the Politico newspaper, citing a source in the Pentagon, wrote that the West is focused on repairing equipment already supplied to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and not on sending new ones weapons. The article indicates that as a result of the counter-offensive, the Ukrainian Armed Forces lost a number of Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, and Leopard tanks were also damaged. It is their repair that is the top priority. On July 16, Business Insider reported that almost a third of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicles that the West sent to Kyiv may already be destroyed, damaged or abandoned. It was noted that the total assistance of the United States to Ukraine included 109 such infantry fighting vehicles. On June 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin, commenting on the destruction of Western equipment by Russian forces, indicated that the Armed Forces (AF) of the Russian Federation destroyed 25–30% of military equipment. According to the head of state, Leopard tanks, like Bradley vehicles, burn well. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which the Russian authorities announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of the worsening situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

In the explanatory note to the document The website is pleased to indicate that parliamentarians are going to appeal to various international organizations, including the UN, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, NATO, and the OSCE. In addition, the deputies intend to urge the Ukrainian government to work out the issue of terminating diplomatic relations between the Ukrainian side and Belarus, and Kyiv’s international partners to increase pressure on Minsk, including by introducing sanctions. “The country has rallied to support our heroes” What is memorable about the main parade on Red Square in 2023? On April 24, political scientist Kirill Averyanov told Izvestia that Ukraine views Belarus as a hostile state, but an attack on the republic is unlikely, since Kyiv fears retaliatory actions from the Union states. This is how he commented on the information posted in the French newspaper Le Monde that France refused to provide Ukraine with data for flights over Belarus. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said on February 17 that the participation of Belarusian troops in a Russian special military operation is unlikely. In his opinion, Belarusian soldiers “don’t want to fight against Ukraine.” On August 30 last year, the Verkhovna Rada took the initiative to recognize Belarus as a country sponsoring terrorism. A draft resolution on an appeal on this issue to the UN, the European Parliament, PACE, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, the OSCE and parliaments and governments of countries has been registered in the Rada.

"30 August 2023","Serbia could become a Trojan horse for Russia if it joins the European Union (EU). This opinion was expressed in an interview with CNN by Maida Ruge, an expert on the Balkans of the European Foreign Affairs Council, on August 29. The channel’s material first of all points out that Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic “has long maintained warm relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.” In this context, it is recalled that Belgrade refused to participate in all EU sanctions against Moscow. “Serbia refused to participate in all EU sanctions against Putin. And Serbia continues to pursue its own interests in the region, <...> being confident that it will not be reproached in the West,” the article says. The authors of the material also note that Serbia “remains heavily dependent on Russia” for energy.” As a result, despite Belgrade’s clear hopes of joining the EU, Vučić continues to balance between Moscow and the Western powers,” the article says. In this regard, the article quotes Ruge, who wondered whether “the entire Serbian integration project is viable given the current government.” “Assuming that we somehow miraculously bring Serbia into the EU, with such a regime you will practically introduce another Russian Trojan horse into the EU, as you did in the person of [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor] Orban. <…> Yes, you can influence expansion, but you are definitely not going to neutralize Russian influence in the region - you are simply importing it into the EU,” Ruge said. “Recognition of Crimea and Donbass by Serbia is possible” Member of the Parliament of the Republic Zoltan Dani - about the situation in Kosovo, the possibility of joining anti-Russian sanctions and relations with Moscow On August 21, Vucic announced the destruction of the EU economy due to NATO’s actions in Ukraine. The Serbian President shared his opinion with American journalist and TV presenter Tucker Carlson on his show. Vučić also said that the Russian economy, on the contrary, is demonstrating strength and resilience in the face of sanctions, which no one expected from it. A day earlier, the Serbian president responded to accusations that he was trying to sit on two chairs between West and East, saying that Belgrade has “its own Serbian chair.” He noted that Serbia's policy is independent and independent. Earlier, at the end of May, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Economic Relations of Hungary, Péter Szijjártó, noted that Serbia and Hungary are under attack in the international arena against the backdrop of their desire for peace in Ukraine and their reluctance to contribute to the escalation of the conflict in territory of this state. In the same month, Vucic said that upon arrival in the country, Western representatives begin the conversation not with greetings, but with calls for anti-Russian sanctions. He added that in response to such calls he wishes “all the best,” emphasizing that the essence of the proposal is clear to him. At the same time, the head of the community’s foreign policy service, Josep Borrell, said that Serbia cannot count on joining the European Union (EU) while maintaining close relations with Russia.

"21 September 2023","Ukrainian television embellished the speech of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky at the 78th session of the UN General Assembly, doctoring the video recording of his speech with footage from other events. The Mash Telegram channel drew attention to this by publishing on Thursday, September 21, a real video of the speech in comparison with a fake one. It is noted that the edited video was published, in particular, by the Ukrainian TV channel “1+1”. Thus, they wanted to show that the Ukrainian leader spoke in a full hall, in front of a large audience, while in fact during his speech the hall was half empty. In the published footage allegedly from Zelensky’s speech, Zelensky himself can be seen sitting in the hall.

Commenting on his speech, American journalist Jesse Waters noted that Zelensky told the UN what it wanted to hear. Permanent Russia's representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya called the UN Security Council meeting with the participation of the Ukrainian president a performance.

"27 January 2024","Dwindling stocks of weapons and financial aid from Western countries will eventually lead Ukraine to the point of no return. Columnist for the American publication Responsible Statecraft Connor Echols wrote about this on January 26. “Ukraine is approaching a turning point,” reads the headline of the article, which talks about a possible Russian victory in the Ukrainian conflict within the next few months, if not weeks. “Failure to provide a new economic assistance will cause serious damage to the government of Ukraine, which currently relies on American and European money,” the expert said. For example, the problems with financing Kyiv from the United States are complemented by the European Union (EU), which is still considering a new aid package worth $54 billion due to confrontation within the association in the person of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban: throughout the entire Ukrainian conflict he has an extremely negative attitude towards support for Ukraine. “The situation is aggravated by the fact that the European Union, which was much more generous with budget support than with military aid faces its own internal struggle over future funding,” Echols writes. We have reached a dead end: the United States cannot agree on further assistance to Kyiv. Republicans linked the issue of supporting Ukraine with the topic of combating illegal migration to the United States. Earlier, on January 16, American Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States does not have a “magic pot” from which to finance Ukraine without approval of requests in Congress. He acknowledged the “real problem” is the situation in which Congress will not approve financial support for Kiev. On the same day, the coordinator for strategic communications at the White House National Security Council, John Kirby, said that the United States is not currently preparing new packages of military assistance to Ukraine due to the ongoing lack of budgetary funds for this. Also on January 16, US Presidential Assistant for National Security Jake Sullivan said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the White House would try to get the US Congress to allocate assistance to Ukraine in the coming weeks. Prior to this, on January 11, Kirby announced a suspension of supplies to Ukraine with American weapons and military equipment due to Washington’s lack of budgetary funds. In addition, on January 3, he noted that the American aid package sent to Kyiv on December 27 would be the last for now. The specified assistance package worth up to $250 million then included weapons and equipment. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by the Russian President on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce support for Kyiv.

The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine reported this on February 29 in its Telegram channel. “The violators wrapped themselves in isothermal blankets so that they would not be noticed by a thermal imager. <…> Administrative protocols have been drawn up for all four,” the department wrote. The evaders explained to the border guards that they were trying to escape to a neighboring country, paying from $3 thousand to $8 thousand for help in illegally crossing the border. They received the route through messengers. Isothermal blankets consist of a film coated with aluminum and maintain body temperature, reflecting up to 80% of its heat using a metal layer. They are usually used to protect against hypothermia in extreme situations. Hole on the border: Kyiv intends to conscript Ukrainian refugees into the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

"15 December 2023","Without funding from the United States and the European Union, Ukraine risks going bankrupt by March 2024, so a Hungarian veto on budget aid to Kyiv could have devastating consequences. The Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported this on Friday, December 15. “There are funds left in the treasury of [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky for less than three months. The situation is really on the verge of maximum danger,” the report says. According to the forecasts of the European Union, as well as Kyiv itself, in the absence of support, March 1 will become the “day of collapse” of the Ukrainian state, the newspaper reports. Therefore, an extraordinary meeting of the European Council will probably take place in January, dedicated to the issue of financing Ukraine. Earlier that day, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that allocating money to Kyiv from the EU budget does not meet the interests of Budapest, since in this case it would be necessary to give away part of the due Hungary funds. A difficult deprivation: Ukraine will not be able to become a member of the EU in the coming years. At the same time, the decision to begin negotiations with Kiev regarding integration was made, despite the position of Hungary. An EU summit is being held in Brussels on December 14–15. At it, European leaders decided to approve the start of negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova on their entry into the union. During a discussion of Ukraine's membership in the EU, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz invited Orban to leave the room and drink coffee, which allowed a unanimous decision to be made on the Ukrainian issue, Politico reported. At the same time, the Hungarian prime minister himself said that Budapest has many opportunities to prevent Ukraine from joining the EU. According to him, 27 parliaments, including the Hungarian one, should have the final say on this issue. On December 15, it also became known that Hungary used its veto power, rejecting the financial assistance program for Ukraine. The support plan for Kyiv included the provision of €50 billion from the EU budget until 2027. 26 EU member countries voted to allocate this amount.

According to it, Berlin will provide Kyiv with one additional IRIS-T anti-aircraft missile system and more than a dozen Gepard anti-aircraft guns in order to protect cargo heading to Romania along the southern coast of Ukraine. In the future, Germany plans to transfer new IRIS-T systems when they are produced. Bloomberg sources did not disclose the specific routes that the new air defense systems are intended to protect, and whether any other means will be involved in this process.

Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said this on Sunday, April 23, in an interview with Al Arabiya channel. “We cannot give up Bakhmut, because it [will] help expand the front and give Russian troops and Wagner a chance to seize more of our lands,” - he said. Zelensky explained that the seizure of this territory would open a springboard for Russia to attack two larger cities in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) - Kramatorsk and Slavyansk. Break test: unblocking attacks of the Air Force in the Artemovsk area were repulsed. The counterattack was thwarted thanks to the clear work of our intelligence, experts say.

Izvestia sources familiar with the situation reported this on Friday, April 14. As noted, most likely we are talking about some model of the T-64/T-72 tank, which was handicraft modernized at Ukrainian factories. Due to its unusual appearance, this tank was mistaken by military personnel for a Leopard. “Recently, there have been very frequent reports of the capture or destruction of American Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. But upon inspection, it turned out that these were M-113 armored personnel carriers, which, due to their unusual appearance, the soldiers incorrectly identified,” explained one of Izvestia’s interlocutors. “Leopard” and other animals: what kind of weapons Ukraine has already received Kyiv is preparing a big offensive, experts made predictions Earlier that day, the commander of one of the units of the volunteer battalion “Falcon” with the call sign Bull reported that a Russian sabotage group had recaptured and sank a tank in a swamp Leopard delivered to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU).

The Republic's Foreign Ministry announced this on its website on May 23. “France, together with its partners, continues to reflect on how best to support Ukraine in the long term and in all areas. France is ready to agree with Ukraine on arrangements to provide security guarantees that will help it protect itself in the long term and prevent possible aggression in the future,” the ministry said in its response to a request from the media. The press service noted that a similar intention was expressed by the Prime Minister Great Britain Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron in the joint declaration of the 36th Franco-British summit held in March.

Washington will be the key partner, and Germany, Great Britain and France will participate in the agreement. On May 21, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, during a meeting with White House President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Hiroshima, asked for security guarantees for the country before it joins NATO. He also thanked the American leader for the new package of military assistance. Also on Sunday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that Ukraine does not meet many of the criteria necessary to join the North Atlantic Alliance. Initially, it was clear that Kyiv would not join the military bloc “in the foreseeable future,” the politician noted. Prior to this, on May 19, military analyst, professor at the Institute of Strategic Studies at the US Army War College, John Denis, shared his opinion that promising Ukraine membership in NATO is now dangerous , since this step could derail potential efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict. On September 30, 2022, the President of Ukraine announced that the country had submitted an application to join the military-political bloc on an accelerated basis. However, Assistant to the President of the United States for National Security Jake Sullivan then indicated that the expansion of the alliance was now untimely.

The diplomat expressed this opinion in an interview with Lenta.ru on Wednesday, March 1. Coming to peace: how the Russian Federation and Ukraine tried to start negotiations Negotiations are scheduled to begin in the Gomel region around noon. According to him, it is not beneficial for the United States and its NATO allies for Russia and Ukraine to agree on peace. He noted that Western countries have invested too much effort and money to create a quarrel between Ukraine and Russia. “For them, Ukraine is a tool with which they are trying to weaken and isolate Russia, break the current security architecture, and preserve their own hegemony, which has been considerably shaken,” Galuzin said. He also named the United States as the main beneficiaries of the Ukrainian crisis. He pointed out that American business and the military-industrial complex (MIC) are “clearly encouraged by the plans” of the administration of US President Joe Biden to continue pumping Kyiv with weapons, as well as the prospect of profiting from the economic problems of European countries. “At the same time, the US is counting on access to Ukrainian minerals - iron ore, manganese ore, rare earth metals, primarily lithium,” added the Deputy Foreign Minister.

This was reported by The New York Times on Tuesday, May 23, with reference to a Ukrainian official. According to the newspaper’s interlocutor, Ukrainian militants were basically allegedly covering the border in case of a counterattack by the Russian Armed Forces, without entering Russian territory.

As Biden noted, the decision was due to climate change, which poses a threat. “During this period, we intend to closely monitor the impact of LNG exports on energy costs, energy US security and the environment,” said the American leader. They drove themselves into a corner: the EU's losses due to anti-Russian sanctions reached $1.5 trillion Expensive energy resources provoked a decline in production Biden's decision to suspend LNG exports could have a negative impact on the EU countries, since, as Bloomberg indicates, the EU does not plan to extend the transit agreement with the Russian Federation gas through Ukraine. The head of the Austrian energy company OMV, Alfred Stern, suggested on January 17 that the transit of Russian gas through the territory of Ukraine may soon cease due to the conflict. He stressed that Moscow and Kyiv still have not signed a new contract on the transit of gas to Europe. Prior to this, the head of the Ukrainian energy company Naftogaz, Alexey Chernyshov, said on October 29 that Ukraine would not renew the contract on the transit of Russian gas to Europe, which expires at the end 2024.

"22 February 2023","Statements by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky about his desire to seize Crimea cause a mixed reaction in the United States, writes journalist Ellie Cook in an article for Newsweek on Wednesday, February 22. In January, Zelensky said that with the presence of heavy weapons from the West, the Ukrainian side would attempt to attack Crimea. “ While some emphasize the importance of the peninsula, others <...> say that insisting on the return of Crimea to Kyiv would be complete madness,” explained the author of the article. “There is one way to ensure the security of Crimea - the destruction of the Kyiv regime” The head of the region, Sergei Aksenov, talks about restoring transport accessibility of the peninsula, strengthening security and the mood of residents and tourists. She noted that some in the United States fear an escalation of the conflict if the Ukrainian army attacks Crimea. Support for similar scenarios do not correspond to the interests of the Americans, Cook added. Last week, US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said that Washington considers attacks by Ukrainian military personnel on the military infrastructure of Crimea legitimate. In addition, she noted that the United States welcomes the desire of the Ukrainian authorities to regain control over the lost territories. However, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken admitted that Ukraine’s attempts to occupy Crimea could lead to a serious response from Russia. In turn, the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Sergei Naryshkin stated that the return of the Crimean Peninsula to Ukrainian control is impossible. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravated situation in the region due to increased shelling by Ukrainian troops. Crimea returned to Russia in 2014 following a referendum in which most of the inhabitants of the peninsula voted in favor of joining the Russian Federation.

"18 April 2023","The conflict in Ukraine has united the West, but it has led to a split in the world, former British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said on April 18. Miliband, in an article for the American magazine Forreign Affairs, points out the special attitude of the West towards Ukraine compared to conflicts in other regions. He said many critics point to the US-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, while arguing that the West is driven by self-interest rather than principle. “The West has shown far more compassion for the victims of the war in Ukraine than for the victims of wars elsewhere yet,” he noted. At the same time, US support for the Saudi-led coalition conflict in Yemen, which has had a devastating impact on the country, is cited as evidence of ambiguity when it comes to caring for civilians. However, the ex-minister does not directly express accusations in the duplicity of Western governments, but gives examples that, in his opinion, demonstrate double standards in their policies. Thus, the former head of the Foreign Ministry notes that the United States’ efforts to protect the rule of law run counter to their actions. He recalled that the United States has not ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, while condemning China for violating it. In addition, the United States has also not ratified the Rome Statute, although it calls for the prosecution of war crimes in Ukraine. Two steps back: how the rhetoric about the Ukrainian crisis is changing in the United States American political elites have different views on the future of the conflict Miliband noted that the conflict in Ukraine really united the West, but it led to a split in the world. And this divide will only widen unless Western powers change their approach. He also proposed changing the attitude towards the Ukrainian conflict and, instead of opposing democracy and autocracy, talking about the struggle of the “rule of law.” According to him, this will help attract new members to the coalition. Earlier, on April 15, it became known that Washington would send another $4.9 billion in budget assistance to Kyiv in September. It is noted that these funds will allow the Ukrainian government to provide “essential services to its citizens.” Prior to this, on March 30, the United States announced that it had allocated $400 million to Ukraine for financial and humanitarian assistance in restoring the destroyed energy system. However, in February, the US Republican Party a split has emerged regarding the volume of assistance provided to Kyiv. American experts interviewed by Izvestia said that a growing number of Republicans are dissatisfied with US President Joe Biden's approach to Ukraine: they want to slow down the growing aid to the regime, especially when it comes to new expensive and provocative weapons. The special operation to protect Donbass is about to begin which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"26 April 2023","The UK is responsible for the consequences of the use of depleted uranium shells that were transferred to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF). Thus, on April 25, the Russian Embassy in London commented on the statement of the kingdom’s Deputy Minister of Defense James Hippy. It is noted that, according to him, London does not monitor the use of these weapons. At the same time, the Ukrainian Armed Forces allegedly bear full responsibility for this. There are also no obligations to eliminate the consequences of their use after the end of the Ukrainian conflict. As the embassy emphasized, at this time the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is discussing the need for countries involved in the supply of such source fissile materials to report to the agency. “It is shocking that the Ministry of Defense does not seem to even realize how hypocritical Taking into account what is happening, their clerical assurances are heard of London’s intention in the future to “lay the foundations” for the successful post-conflict reconstruction of Ukraine. We urge the British authorities not to indulge themselves with illusory hopes that by turning the switch to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which now have toxic ammunition at their disposal, they will be able to get away with it. London will not be able to shift responsibility for the crimes they commit onto its Kyiv wards,” TASS quotes the text of the embassy’s commentary. Evil spirits: what is the danger of supplying Ukraine with shells with depleted uranium? And how Russia will respond to the use of weapons with a nuclear component. Earlier this day, British Deputy Secretary of Defense James Heppy announced that London had sent thousands of shells for Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv, including those with depleted uranium. As he emphasized, all military equipment and ammunition provided by London are under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces; the British Ministry of Defense does not monitor where and how they are used. In turn, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called on London to realize its responsibility for the transfer of depleted ammunition to the Ukrainian Armed Forces uranium and consequences from missiles. On April 10, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Ukraine would become an uninhabited country due to British-supplied depleted uranium ammunition. She noted that in places where such shells were used, a multiple increase in cancer cases was recorded. On March 22, Lavrov said that London’s supply of shells with depleted uranium to Kyiv would be a further step towards a “serious, high-quality increase in escalation.” He also drew attention to the fact that the use of ammunition with depleted uranium will sharply reduce, if at all preserve, Ukraine’s ability to produce high-quality, uncontaminated food. British Deputy Defense Minister Annabelle Goldie spoke about plans to supply Kyiv with ammunition with depleted uranium on March 21. Western countries have strengthened their military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to launch a special operation was made on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of a worsening situation in the region due to increased shelling by Ukrainian militants.

She announced this at a briefing on Thursday, March 30. She emphasized that the West, together with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, is destroying the Ukrainian people. “And the supply of weapons and the allocation of billions of dollars for combat operations is not a cynical trap? This, apparently, is just an effective trap from his (the West. - Ed.) point of view. In fact, the Ukrainian army is being driven to slaughter by their handlers from Washington,” the diplomat said. Thus, Zakharova commented on the words of American Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who earlier, on March 28, noted that calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine could be a “cynical trap.” Evil spirits: what is the danger of supplying Ukraine with shells with depleted uranium? And how will Russia respond to the use of weapons with a nuclear component?

A week before, on March 21, it became known about the West’s plans to supply Kiev with ammunition containing depleted uranium, which is a nuclear component.

We won't let this happen. This belief is at the core of my approach to supporting the people of Ukraine,” he wrote. According to Biden, the US commitment to support Ukraine today is an investment in its own security, as it will prevent a larger conflict tomorrow. “We are keeping US troops from participating in this ""conflict"", supporting the brave Ukrainians defending their freedom and land. We provide them with weapons and economic assistance,” he said. Well, help: American assistance to Ukraine will be revised. The form of support and its content will change, and the amounts will become smaller. On October 19, the American president already announced the thesis that assistance to Ukraine and Israel is a “smart investment” that will bring dividends to future generations. He stated this in an address to the nation. At the same time, on November 17, Defense One reported that deputies of the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada were complaining about a shortage of ammunition against the backdrop of the US decision to redirect shells reserved for Ukraine to Israel. Deputy Alexandra Ustinova said that she was afraid to come to the front, where “people literally have nothing to shoot with.” On November 16, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, during a conversation with reporters, said that due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) began to experience a shortage of 155 -millimeter artillery shells. He noted that the ammunition supplied by Western countries cannot meet the needs of the army.

"21 April 2023","The countries of the collective West must convince Kyiv to negotiate with Russia, otherwise Ukraine will be destroyed. Retired US Army Lt. Col. Daniel Davis wrote in an article for 19FortyFive on Thursday, April 20. “To achieve lasting peace, Western leaders must privately tell [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky that indefinite military, political and financial support will the Western side will end by a certain time, and therefore he must conclude the best deal with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to end the war,” the military man noted. According to him, in the event of negotiations, it is necessary to understand that Donbass and Crimea will not return to control Kyiv. However, Ukraine has no other option.

The corresponding request was voiced during the Ukrainian leader’s February visit to Paris.

As an example, he cited the latest aid package from Germany, which included ten Leopard tanks 1 A5.“Leopard 1 is even older, <…> with light armor, a small cannon. It does not cover Ukraine’s needs on the battlefield,” he added. All the assistance provided by Western countries is not capable of changing the outcome of the counteroffensive, he concluded.

At the same time, on April 20, Vucic said that the conflict in Ukraine showed the whole world the hypocrisy of the West. NATO officials regularly call on Serbia to become part of the alliance because, in their opinion, Russia will put everyone at risk, he added. On April 19, Vucic said that Belgrade strives to remain military neutral, despite Sweden's demand to impose sanctions against Russia and harmonize its foreign policy from European. At the same time, in early April, the Serbian leader stated that the country’s authorities are trying to maintain their neutrality regarding the West and Russia, but do not guarantee that this will be maintained. Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic indicated on March 26 that Western countries are unfairly demanding that Belgrade impose sanctions against Russia, but at the same time they themselves are increasing trade turnover with the Russian Federation. Prior to this, on March 24, Peskov spoke on the topic of pressure from Western countries on states friendly to Russia. Thus, Moscow is sympathetic to the actions of its allies regarding the ban on circumventing anti-Russian sanctions. According to the press secretary, partner countries themselves talk about the threats they receive from Western countries for their reluctance to introduce restrictive measures against the Russian Federation. Western countries have increased sanctions pressure on Russia against the backdrop of a special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to start it was made after the situation in the region worsened due to Ukrainian shelling.

Kremlin official representative Dmitry Peskov announced this on March 6 during a speech at the Knowledge marathon. The first” on the sidelines of the World Youth Festival in Sirius. “This telephone conversation generally showed the completely outrageous situation that is happening in the country. Either the authorities there don’t know what the military is doing, or they, the authorities and the military, are doing something that could have very serious consequences for all Germans,” Peskov said. According to the Kremlin official representative, Russia does not want a war with Germany, but at the same time it does not want other states to plot to blow up something on its territory.

The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on March 2 that the German authorities are engaged in investigation into the leak of a recording of a conversation between German officers and called this situation a “very serious problem.” Bild reported then that Graefe was to blame for the incident because he connected to the conversation from Singapore through an unsecured network, creating a threat to the security of the conversation.

Reuters reported this on May 18, citing sources. “We found discrepancies in how we assessed the equipment delivered,” a senior Pentagon source told the publication.

On April 26, Ukraine complained about the lack of promised equipment from NATO. Advisor to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president, Mikhail Podolyak, emphasized that there should be much more equipment. This is how he responded to the statement of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of NATO Armed Forces in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, about Ukraine receiving more than 98% of weapons from the United States and allied countries. At the same time, Pentagon Press Secretary Patrick Ryder promised on March 21 to transfer obsolete models of the Abrams tank to the Kyiv authorities by the fall.

"29 October 2023","Washington and European countries must insist on Kyiv's decision to negotiate with Moscow to achieve peace. The consequences of continuing the conflict could be fatal for the West. Former adviser to US President Ronald Reagan Doug Bandow wrote about this in a column for The American Conservative. He noted that Western countries are tired of the impasse that is destroying Ukraine, killing Ukrainians without an ultimate goal and costing the West itself dearly. Washington and the Europeans must propose a new security system that supports Ukrainian sovereignty but allows for Ukrainian neutrality. Europe should talk to Russia about restoring peace and stability by showing a willingness to return frozen assets and lift sanctions. “The starting point for this change should be the end of congressional aid, which will ultimately lead to the end of American support beyond humanitarian aid. The consequences will be dire for Ukraine, but the alternatives are even worse—costly and ineffective. Washington must take the initiative to end the hostilities, which it has encouraged so much,” the material says. Bandow explained that Ukraine could win if the allies became directly involved in the conflict, but such an outcome “would be suicide.” Expendable business: Hungary opposed new funding to Ukraine And called for the start of peace negotiations On October 27, the former director for Russian affairs at the US National Security Council, Fiona Hill, in an interview with Foreign Policy magazine, said that Russian President Vladimir Putin knows that the conflict in Ukraine is developing in benefit Russia. She suggested that Western leaders had become victims of inflated expectations about what the Ukrainian army was actually capable of during the counteroffensive. On the same day, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko called on the Ukrainians to come to the negotiating table without preconditions. He noted that for this it is necessary to stop the advance of troops and any conduct of hostilities. The next day, the head of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, Peter Szijjártó, noted that Hungary is ready to host negotiations between representatives of Moscow and Kyiv if they so wish. Budapest has repeatedly offered a platform for the negotiation process to representatives of Russia and Ukraine as “an unbiased, impartial, safe place that guarantees all of them equal and safe playing conditions,” he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated on October 18 that Ukraine needs to cancel the decree prohibiting negotiations, if it wants to start the negotiation process.

"27 May 2023","The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) in the city of Kropyvnytskyi, Kirovograd region of Ukraine, was leased to the schismatic Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU). Previously, the building was transferred to the municipal property of the city. “The Kropyvnytskyi city council agreed on the lease of the temple building in Kropyvnytskyi, which is communal property to ensure the conduct of religious rites and ceremonies on preferential terms without an auction with a rent of one hryvnia per year for five years of the religious organization “Management of the Kropyvnytsia Diocese of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine,” RIA Novosti quotes a message from the city council. The monastery was let down: the Ukrainian authorities again tried to seal the Kyiv Lavra. Armed police were brought into the territory of the monastery, but the believers defended the shrine. A priest of the Kirovograd diocese had previously come under criminal prosecution in Ukraine. On May 12, the court sentenced the former ruling bishop of the Kirovograd diocese of the UOC, Metropolitan Joasaph (Peter Guben) and the secretary of the diocese Roman Kondratyuk to three years in prison in the case of inciting religious hatred. The case was opened on the basis of SBU documents. The agency claims that in churches, representatives of the clergy distributed “hostile literature” printed in the Russian Federation to people. In May, raider seizures of churches in Ukraine resumed. Thus, on May 7, there was an attempt to seize the St. Nicholas Church in the village of Mytintsy, Khmelnytsky region. The raiders broke the lock on the gate and broke into the territory of the temple, where at that moment believers of the canonical UOC were praying. On the same day, the Union of Orthodox Journalists reported on the seizure of St. Michael's Church in the city of Boyarka, Kyiv region, by schismatics. After this, parishioners of the UOC had to pray in the open air. On May 20, supporters of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) illegally seized the St. Elias Church of the UOC in the village of Borochich, Volyn region. Church parishioners did not take part in the meeting at which the decision to transfer to the jurisdiction of the OCU was allegedly agreed upon. The Union of Orthodox Journalists reported on May 27 that the police banned the UOC from holding a religious procession, citing martial law. The pressure of OCU supporters on the UOC intensified after the publication of a warning on March 10 on the Lavra website with the signature of Alexander Rudnik, who at that time was the acting General Director of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra National Reserve, that the monks must leave the monastery by March 29. They were offered to remain in the Lavra on the condition of transferring to the schismatic OCU. Despite regular attacks, representatives of the UOC remain on the territory of the Lavra.

"October 2023","The fight against corruption will be one of the key areas of Ukraine’s unified reform plan until 2027. Prime Minister Denis Shmygal announced this on October 5 at the presentation of the anti-corruption program of the Ministry of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure. The reforms are being developed by Kiev based on the “concept of strengthening the sustainability of democracy in Ukraine” by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and the demands of the West, which, according to Shmygal, should be fully taken into account. The Ukrainian minister also noted that an anti-corruption program would be presented on this day. It will be a continuation of the plan already adopted by the government for 2023–2025. The Prime Minister said that the program will include 1.7 thousand events in 15 areas. Thus, it is planned to introduce 63 new digital products, which, according to Shmygal, “will significantly reduce the opportunities for any abuse.” At the same time, he noted that all ministries of Ukraine will have to adopt their own current anti-corruption plans. The UN will be kind and affectionate: the international organization needs reforms. However, it will be very difficult to carry them out. On September 26, the White House called on Kyiv to carry out a number of structural reforms to be able to receive further assistance from the United States. The demands were set out in a document entitled “List of Priority Reforms. Reforms associated with the terms of assistance from the United States"" and include a wide range of changes in various sectors of the economy and defense. In particular, it was proposed to reform the country's security service. According to the text of the document, Kyiv has 18 months to implement all the requirements. The next day, Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Anti-Corruption Policy Committee Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, in an interview with the Ukrainian radio station NV, called the US administration’s decision to link the issue of arms supplies to Kyiv with reforms in Ukraine a mistake.

He stated this in an interview with CNN on March 8. He also assured that Russian soil does not interest him, and the Ukrainian army does not have weapons to respond to shelling from the other bank of the Dnieper. “That’s why I emphasize the need for long-range weapons. If we can push the Russians back further with these weapons, they will not be able to threaten us,” he said. According to Zelensky, the territory within the 1991 borders is Ukrainian. He also admitted that he does not imagine the circumstances that would lead to a meeting and negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We do not have the slightest confidence in him. Russia must leave our territory. And after that, we are happy to join diplomatic instruments,” Zelensky said. Aviatorg: Zelensky did not get fighters from the EU How did the first day of the European Council meeting, which the Ukrainian president attended, go? On February 23, the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Dmitry Kuleba said that Kyiv will not use fighters and long-range weapons if they are supplied by Western countries for attacks on Russian territory. At the same time, he emphasized that Ukraine will use these weapons “to liberate territories.” On February 21, Bloomberg wrote that the United States will transfer to Ukraine high-precision JDAM-ER bombs with a flight range of up to 72 km and GPS guidance. The US Department of Defense has not officially confirmed the shipment of such ammunition. However, on December 21 last year, the Pentagon announced that the next package of military assistance to Ukraine would include “high-precision aircraft munitions,” without naming their model and quantity. At the same time, the Russian President named Moscow’s retaliatory step in the event of supplies of long-range weapons to Kyiv. According to him, the more long-range ammunition arrives in Ukraine, the further Russia will be forced to push Ukrainian troops away from its borders.

"26 July 2023","Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, called Britain's chairmanship of the UN Security Council (SC) in July a disgrace. The diplomat emphasized that the British permanent mission is trying to impose its own agenda on the Security Council. “This is a real shame. The chairman should be neutral and lead the council’s efforts in discussing certain issues, and not impose his own agenda,” Polyansky said on July 26. Earlier on Wednesday, Polyansky indicated that Kyiv continues its repressive policy towards canonical Orthodoxy and at the same time finds support from the West. This is how the diplomat assessed the British presidency’s refusal to allow the representative of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), Bishop Gideon, to speak at the UN Security Council meeting. We will be judged: the abbot of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel was sent to a pre-trial detention center. Under whose pressure was such a decision made and will the metropolitan be allowed to take insulin in the detention center? For the same reason, Russia refused to speak at the UN Security Council meeting on the grain deal. Earlier in July, Russia called for July 26 to be held UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine, in particular on the topic of repression against the canonical UOC. At the same time, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Moscow would raise the issue of persecution of Metropolitan Pavel at the upcoming UN Security Council meeting on the topic of the UOC. On July 14, the Solomensky Court of Kyiv changed the measure of restraint for Metropolitan Pavel from house arrest to detention until August 14. This verdict is associated with the presentation of new charges to the clergyman that he doubted the “sovereignty of Ukraine” and denied “aggression” on the part of the Russian Federation.

Now at the checkpoint in Medyka due to the blocking of the checkpoint by protesters The queue is about 30 km long, and drivers have to wait about 127 hours.

In oppression and resentment: where and how Russians were discriminated against in 2022 Experts listed the areas in which our citizens faced Russophobia It is known that even children of primary school age became victims of attacks. Thus, in one of the cases, Hertfordshire County police provided details of a racially motivated attack soil, when the victim was knocked to the floor at a pedestrian crossing, and the attacker told her: “All Russians are murderers.” Devon and Cornwall Police also described a case in which victims were followed by an unknown man in a supermarket, ""calling them names and threatening to kill them because they were Russian.""

The police said that he threatened her with the words: “Why are you still here?” And he left a note in the woman’s letterbox telling her to go home. Meanwhile, another North Wales woman had an “obscene word” appear on her car, which she believes was “due to the mistaken belief that she allegedly from Russia.” Also in Derbyshire, a worker attacked a victim on a construction site, saying: “I hate you Russians, you kill people.” On January 16, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Yevgeny Ivanov said that Moscow was recording attempts to set fire to Russian embassies and to arrange an accident with Russian diplomats in Western countries against the backdrop of artificially inflated Russophobic hysteria. He clarified that the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation opened criminal cases in some cases.

"October 2023","The Russian Embassy called the statements of the current and former British Defense Ministers Grant Shapps and Ben Wallace reckless and provocative. The department’s commentary was published on Monday, October 2, on its website. In particular, the Russian Embassy recalled Shapps’s recent proposal to transfer the British program for training Ukrainian Armed Forces fighters to the territory of Ukraine, establishing the production of NATO-style weapons there, as well as his idea of assisting Kyiv with the British military ships in the “protection of civilian shipping in the Black Sea.” “Similarly inappropriate statements have been made by Shapps’ associates in the ruling Conservative Party, including his predecessor, former Defense Secretary Wallace,” the statement said. It is noted that the ex-minister also, without having the information, “imagined that Ukraine was winning” and demanded in this regard to provide the regime of President Vladimir Zelensky with more long-range systems, as well as “double funding for the Ukrainian military for the near future.” “London literally is gushing with reckless and provocative statements, indicating a line for further escalation in the area where the NWO is being held,” the embassy said in a statement. It also points out “the loss of a sense of reality and common sense by British politicians.” “The British political class has finally become detached from the situation “on the ground” and has soared into the world of dreams, where the Kiev regime is winning mythical victories <...> In London they just don’t want to accept the truth, which lies in the fact that the much-advertised counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has stopped with minimal progress,” the embassy noted. Team “Pass”: how Ukraine was defended by the entire West The Russian minister never met at the same table with Zelensky at the UN Security Council. A day earlier, Senator Alexei Pushkov, commenting on Shapps’ statements, called him a “maniac.” He added that each new British defense minister is worse than the previous one. The degree of madness in London is growing, he noted. Member of the US House of Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, in turn, pointed out that if Great Britain sends its troops to Ukraine, it could start a third world war. She stressed that the United States cannot participate in this. According to Green, the United States should protect its borders. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 by Russian leader Vladimir Putin after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"12 August 2023","The scale of losses of military equipment on the battlefield by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) indicates an overestimation by the West of the ability of the Ukrainian military to master and use it. This was pointed out on August 11 by Franz-Stefan Gadi, a military analyst at the Center for a New American Security, in a comment to The Messenger portal. “There was a sense of “technical optimism” because Ukrainian soldiers were so good at training on Western equipment, there was a feeling that they would be able to implement this into tactical skill. Some observers overestimated the ability of the Ukrainian military to acquire tactical skills with this equipment and be able to use it jointly in combat,” he said. Losses of heavy equipment in the first weeks of the offensive forced the Ukrainians to change tactics. According to Gadi, a direct consequence of the loss of equipment is that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are now fighting with the supremacy of infantry with artillery shelling of Russian positions. “Only in isolated cases can one see advances or attacks led by mechanized troops,” the expert noted. The portal in the article refers to the blog Oryx, which records losses of APU equipment that can be confirmed by photographic evidence. It states that at least 23 Bradley vehicles were destroyed, another 21 were damaged, and five were abandoned on the battlefield. “More than 60 M113 armored fighting vehicles, 57 Maxxpro mine-resistant vehicles and more than 100 Humvees were also destroyed, damaged or lost. The value of all this destroyed equipment is likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars,” the material states. “All attempts at a counteroffensive have been stopped” Vladimir Putin called the losses of the Ukrainian army on August 11 The Hill called the Western miscalculations during the counteroffensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces a gift for the Russian Federation. Russia will be able to profitably use the miscalculations of Western curators in preparing for the counter-offensive and the discord between them regarding the issue of continuing to sponsor Kyiv to its advantage. Also on August 10, The Washington Post reported that the failed counter-offensive and the huge number of dead Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers are causing disappointment among the civilian population of Ukraine. Since the beginning of the counteroffensive, the publication noted, Ukrainian officials and representatives of Western countries have spoken in vivid colors about it and the benefits it could bring to the Ukrainian people. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues .

"13 October 2023","The Vatican is ready “for any necessary mediation” in the Middle East, Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Parolin said in an interview with the newspaper L'Osservatore Romano on October 13. “The Holy See, as always, is ready for any necessary mediation. The one who is attacked has the right to defend himself, but in self-defense the principle of proportionality must be observed,” TASS reports the cardinal’s words. He also noted that the Vatican’s priority is the release of hostages held by the Palestinian group Hamas. Earlier, on October 8, RIA Novosti reported that Pope Francis called for an end to armed clashes in Israel and Palestine. He emphasized that terrorism and war can only lead to suffering and death. Pope Francis and senior Vatican hierarchs have repeatedly indicated their readiness to play a mediating role in the Ukrainian settlement. On May 13, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky rejected the Vatican’s proposal to resolve the conflict. He explained his decision by saying that Kyiv does not need intermediaries. The Pope can: what goals does the Vatican pursue in Ukraine? The Holy See has its own plans for the end of the conflict.

According to the latest data, the number of Israeli casualties after the Hamas attack increased to 1.3 thousand people, and another 3.3 thousand were injured. On the Palestinian side, 1,537 residents were killed and 6,612 were injured. The Palestinians are trying to ensure that future borders between the two countries follow the lines that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967, with a possible exchange of territories. Palestine wants to create its own state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and make East Jerusalem its capital. Israel refuses to return to the 1967 borders and divide Jerusalem.

The call to the United States was published on Thursday, July 6, on the organization's website. The US government is close to allowing the transfer of cluster munitions from its own stockpiles to Ukraine, HRW reports. ""The transfer of these weapons will inevitably lead to prolonged suffering for civilians and undermine international condemnation of them use,” the organization clarified. Missile strikes by the Armed Forces of Ukraine with cluster munitions on Russian-controlled areas of the city of Izyum in 2022 led to numerous civilian casualties, HRW said, citing its research.

"21 February 2024","In 2024, Russia will forge ties with the G20 to strengthen the voice of countries in the Global South and East, and work to ensure that the grouping agenda is not politicized. This is stated in a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, published for the upcoming participation of the head of the department, Sergei Lavrov, in the G20 Ministerial Council on February 21–22. “As the chairman of BRICS in 2024, Russia plans to establish a close partnership with the G20 to achieve cumulative effect and further strengthening the voice of the countries of the Global South and East in leading multilateral structures,” says the text posted on the website of the Russian Foreign Ministry on February 21. The ministry also noted that Russia intends to draw special attention of partners to the unacceptability of politicization of the G20, because, according to the mandate , it must concentrate exclusively on socio-economic problems and cannot be an alternative to the UN Security Council, which has exclusive prerogatives to maintain world order. “The inclusion of non-core problems, including the Ukrainian issue, on the G20 agenda at the instigation of the West is destructive. This multiplies disagreements between participants and distances our forum from the sought-after achievements in its area of competence,” the statement says. Vostok news: the G20 statement wanted to reflect not only the Ukrainian issue. A number of participating countries pointed out the absence of other conflicts in the declaration, including between Israel and Palestine. Earlier, on February 20, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived at the Venezuelan diplomatic office for negotiations with Minister Ivan Hilem Pinto. The agenda of the meeting included political dialogue, the development of strategic partnerships, as well as joint projects in the trade and cultural fields. Lavrov arrived in Caracas after visiting Cuba, where his Latin American tour began. After Caracas, Lavrov goes to Brazil for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the G20 countries from February 21 to 22. Earlier, on January 10, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova suggested that at a meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the West will once again try to fraudulently win over the countries of the Global South and East. Later, in a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the fourth meeting on Ukraine, held in Davos, Switzerland, turned out to be a failure for Kyiv and its Western hosts. Prior to this, on December 18, Lavrov reported that statements by the leaders of Western countries about their interest in the development of the global South and East are “talk and pure lies.” According to him, as an example, it is worth looking and comparing promises and actual deliveries with what was transferred by Western countries to Ukraine. On December 13, the Russian Foreign Minister said that Western countries want to do everything to prevent rapprochement between Russia and the Global South. He noted that representatives of Western states “run around the world” and threaten countries with punishments for interacting with the Russian Federation. As the minister pointed out, Russia is ready for such a challenge and it is clear from real cases that the country will continue to firmly defend its truth. In addition, Lavrov noted that the Russian “responsible line, based on the principles of the UN Charter, enjoys the broadest support of the world majority states.” Earlier, in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized that lasting global peace will be established only when everyone feels safe and know that their opinions are respected. According to him, if a country is aimed at hegemony, and arbitrariness reigns in the system, then anyone can be under attack.

"28 September 2023","The United States of America has begun specialized language training for pilots of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU), who are planned to be trained in the future to fly American F-16 fighters. Deputy Press Secretary of the US Department of Defense Sabrina Singh announced this on September 28 at a regular briefing. “Yes, English language courses have begun,” she said, answering a journalist’s question. Singh then added that she did not have more detailed information. It is unknown exactly how many Ukrainian pilots have started studying the language program and what time frame is allocated for this course. It is noted that the latter will depend on the “skills and professionalism” of the pilots being trained. Finger in the sky: what will the transfer of F-16 fighters to Ukraine lead to? Kyiv may receive the first batch of aircraft before the New Year. On August 31, it was reported that training of Ukrainian pilots is also underway in Denmark and the UK. Ukrainian military pilots will learn to fly F-16 fighters in Denmark for four to six months, and in the UK for a year or two. Later, on September 10, the American magazine WSJ announced the possibility of Kyiv starting combat missions this winter. At the same time, on August 16, Advisor to the Command of the Air Force (VVS) of the Ukrainian troops, Yuriy Ignat, on the air of the Telethon program, announced the impossibility of receiving F-16 fighters this year. On September 12, Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that deliveries of F-16s to Ukraine will only they prolong the conflict and do not fundamentally change anything on the battlefield. Earlier, on August 20, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced an agreement with the Danish authorities on the supply of F-16s. It was reported that 19 fighters would be transferred to Kyiv. The Ukrainian leader also agreed on a similar transfer with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. It is expected that Ukraine will receive a total of 42 aircraft. At the same time, military expert Vasily Dandykin, in an interview with Izvestia, noted that Ukraine will probably not receive the F-16s promised by Western countries in the fall or winter of this year, since it has problems with personnel training. He also noted that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are not yet ready to host such “rather capricious aircraft,” since the country does not have the necessary road structure. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022 of the year. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to the aggression of Ukrainian troops.

The day before, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that Kyiv is competing with other states for the right to receive ammunition from Western manufacturers. According to him, the country's authorities have developed a defense production strategy and launched defense industrial programs to reduce the risk of supplies of ammunition, missiles and other weapons. Guns instead of butter: Finland intends to supply Ukraine with shells Helsinki continues to support the Kyiv regime Before this, on December 20, it was reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are experiencing an acute shortage of ammunition and drones in the special operation zone. Former President of the country Petro Poroshenko noted that there was a shortage of such weapons, while there were “tens of thousands” of them in special warehouses. Poroshenko called the current situation a crime “that needs to be punished.” On December 2, Danish radio DR journalist Matilda Kimer reported that pessimistic sentiments among military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are intensifying, as they understand that they do not have enough resources to confront the armed forces RF. A big disappointment for Ukrainians is that they think the Russians have inexhaustible resources. In October, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal said that Kyiv, like the rest of the world, is experiencing an ammunition shortage. According to him, this indicates that the country must organize the production of weapons on its territory.

The chancellor also emphasized that they are both always polite to each other and communicate on a first-name basis. Within the framework of normality: Germany does not want to build relations with Russia Some German politicians want to establish ties with Moscow, others are opposed In February, Olaf Scholz noted that the German authorities are confident in the need to maintain regular contact with Vladimir Putin “in the hope of some progress forward.” On February 2, Scholz stated that efforts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy must continue.

"11 September 2023","Berlin should begin supplying Taurus long-range missiles to Kyiv as soon as possible. This opinion was expressed by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba during a press conference on September 11. “You will do it anyway. <...> I don’t understand why we are wasting time,” he said, addressing his German colleague Annalena Bärbock. Radius of inaction: the German Foreign Minister discussed Taurus deliveries in Kyiv. How much Berlin has already spent on supporting Ukraine and why Annalena Bärbock was worried about corruption in the country. Earlier that day, Kuleba noted that the Ukrainian side is “ready to do everything necessary” to speed up the process of approving the transfer of Taurus. On September 8, Annalena Berbock explained that the supply of long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv is fraught with difficulties, since they require discussion of every detail. In turn, the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, Mikhail Podolyak, said that the army needs long-range weapons in order to “minimize losses and reduce mobilization needs” in the country. Prior to this, on September 5, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine assured that Kyiv does not plan to use long-range missiles Taurus outside the “internationally recognized borders” of the republic in the event of their transfer from Germany. Kuleba expressed hope that the delivery of missiles will take place in the near future. Deliveries of Taurus missiles were planned by the German government in early August. Discussion of this issue began after French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his readiness to transfer long-range missiles to Kyiv on July 11. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which has been ongoing since February 24, 2022.

"November 13 2023","The failure of the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU), the conflict in the Middle East, as well as US internal political problems have a favorable impact on Russia’s achievement of its goals in a special military operation in the Donbass and Ukraine. This opinion was expressed by geopolitics and Russia specialist Carole Grimaud-Pottet in a conversation with La Dépêche on November 11. “It is true that in the current context we seem to be part of a paradigm shift. Several factors suggest that we are moving towards a result beneficial for the Russians,” the expert said. She noted that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas movement has diverted media attention from the situation in Ukraine, while US President Joe Biden is finding it increasingly difficult to highlight large amounts to finance Kyiv due to contradictions in Congress. In addition, Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with Biden, which casts doubt on his re-election as president in 2024, Grimaud-Pottet noted. This could also turn out favorably for Moscow. “From the very beginning, time was on [Russian President] Vladimir Putin’s side,” the expert believes. Well, help: American aid to Ukraine will be revised. The form of support and its content will change, and the amounts will become smaller. Earlier, on November 9, ex-CIA intelligence officer Phil Giraldi said that the United States realized that it had lost in the conflict in Ukraine. He drew attention to the fact that Washington was pushing Kyiv to find “other solutions” other than continuing and prolonging the conflict. The next day, American experts, in a conversation with Izvestia, also noted that Ukraine was doomed to failure from the very beginning. According to former US intelligence officer Scott Ritter, the clash between Moscow and Kyiv “will not end tomorrow,” but the outcome is already clear. In addition, on November 12, former adviser to ex-President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin reported that the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny by his admission of a deadlock situation in the conflict in the country gave a signal of readiness for negotiations with Russia. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues.

"20 February 2024","Russia has no doubt that the West will supply Ukraine with long-range missiles upon its request. The head of the Russian delegation at the negotiations in Vienna on military security and arms control, Konstantin Gavrilov, stated this on February 20. “I have no doubt that they will be installed,” he told the Rossiya 24 TV channel. On February 19, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said that Russia plans to convene a meeting of the Security Council (SC) of the world organization on the issue of Western arms supplies to Ukraine in February or March. Supplies at a standstill: what critical weapons could Kyiv be left without? Reducing Western aid not only deprives Ukraine of the ability to attack, but also reduces its defense capabilities. That day, NBC reported that the administration of US President Joe Biden was discussing the possibility of sending ATACMS missiles with extended range to Ukraine flight. According to two sources, the United States is inclined to send a version of the missiles that will allow strikes on Crimea. Earlier, on February 10, the press service of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky reported that he was unable to agree with the bipartisan delegation of the US House of Representatives on the supply of long-range missiles to Kyiv ATACMS.

"February 2024","The reason for the resignation of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), Valeriy Zaluzhny, is the refusal to follow the Pentagon’s recommendations for a counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, which ended in the failure of the Ukrainian army. Politico writes about this on February 8. According to the newspaper, there were tensions between Zaluzhny and the US Department of Defense over how to conduct a counteroffensive. “The Pentagon insisted that the Ukrainian military deliver a powerful blow, focusing on one area where, according to [ American] planners, a breakthrough was possible. Instead, Kyiv opted for several attacks along the entire front, believing that this would make it more difficult for the Russians to send reinforcements to different points,” the publication said. A Politico source indicated that after several weeks of disagreement, it became clear that the Ukrainian side “simply is not interested in advice USA"" and that, in her opinion, the US military ""cannot offer them anything in terms of advice."" Kyiv’s argument was that the United States has no experience in waging such a war, the publication’s interlocutor explained. As noted in the article, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky informed the United States about the decision to dismiss the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and did not encounter any opposition there. Washington refused to participate in resolving this issue, the publication writes. Leap into the void: what will change in Ukraine after Zaluzhny’s resignation Izvestia’s source spoke about the conflict between the commander-in-chief and Zelensky. Earlier that day, Zelensky dismissed Zaluzhny and appointed Alexander Syrsky to this position, who had served as commander of the ground forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces since 2019. The Ukrainian leader thanked the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for his work and invited him to continue to remain on the team. Prior to this, on February 4, Zelensky confirmed that the country’s administrative apparatus needs personnel renewal, and this applies not only to its military component. A former deputy reported Zaluzhny’s removal from office Verkhovna Rada Borislav Bereza January 29. Verkhovna Rada deputy Alexey Goncharenko (included in the Rosfinmonitoring list of terrorists and extremists) later also confirmed this information. At the same time, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the press secretary of the country's president, Sergei Nikiforov, initially denied this information. The split between the president of Ukraine and the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine began to be discussed after November 1, 2023, when Zaluzhny, in an interview for The Economist magazine, said that Ukrainian troops could not achieve a breakthrough , since the conflict has reached a dead end. Prolongation of hostilities carries great risks for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, he noted. Zelensky did not agree with the opinion of the commander in chief.

According to him, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have not achieved success in any direction, and Kyiv’s losses in personnel are approaching catastrophic.

"20 April 2023","South Korea does not supply weapons to Ukraine for the sake of stability in relations with Russia. A source in the administration of South Korean President Yoon Seok Yeol spoke about this on Thursday, April 20. According to the informant, the decision to provide military assistance to the Kyiv regime is not limited by national legislation. However, its adoption depends on the actions of Moscow. “The reason why we do not take such actions (supplying weapons to Ukraine. - Ed.) voluntarily is that we want to maintain relations between Korea and Russia on a stable basis, while actively participating in international communities to help the Ukrainian people,” a Yonhap source said. NATO decided: the alliance announced new arms supplies to Kyiv Do the countries of the bloc have weapons capable of turning the tide, and how such decisions affect the prospects of the negotiation process On April 19, the country's President Yoon Seok-yeol said that South Korea could expand support for Ukraine to arms supplies. This was the first time Seoul announced its readiness to provide ammunition to Ukraine - more than a year after it ruled out the possibility of providing lethal assistance.

"August 2023","The US Army has begun work on a new weapons strategy based on lessons learned from monitoring the Ukrainian conflict. This was reported on Tuesday, August 1, by the weekly Defense News, citing the head of the country's Army Advanced Development Command, James Rainey. “We have carefully studied strategic shooting, which underlies the strategy of using targeted fire. Now we are doing the same for conventional weapons,” the publication quotes the top commander as saying. According to Rainey, the new tactics will determine the capabilities and potential of existing weapons, as well as the army’s needs in the future. According to him, both conventional types of weapons and high-precision weapons are important for the army. He added that the strategy is based on the needs of the Pacific units of the American troops and on the conduct of combat operations by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. “As we see from the situation in Ukraine, high-precision weapons and new technology is important, but traditional high-explosive artillery plays a key role on the battlefield,” Rainey concluded. NATO decided: the alliance announced new arms supplies to Kyiv Do the countries of the bloc have weapons capable of turning the tide, and how such decisions affect the prospects of the negotiation process Earlier, on July 31, it was reported that the American company General Dynamics received a contract from the US Department of Defense in the amount of $33 .8 million from the army budget and assistance funds to Ukraine for technical support of Abrams tanks.

And, unfortunately, escalation is also taking place,” Duma TV quoted the deputy as saying for Izvestia. Cassette pass: Kyiv is quarreling London and Washington before the NATO summit What caused the split between the allies and why the “special relationship” between the US and Great Britain is coming to an end Earlier in the day, the head of the Russian delegation at the negotiations in Vienna on military security and arms control, Konstantin Gavrilov stated to RIA Novosti that contacts in Vienna indicate that NATO is unlikely to be directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, but will test the Russian Federation’s strength.

"22 September 2023","Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party may lose voter support due to a quarrel with Ukraine. The Politico newspaper wrote about this on Thursday, September 21. The authors of the article pointed out that the majority of PiS supporters still support pro-Ukrainian policies, as public opinion polls show. Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, millions of ordinary Poles have helped Ukrainian refugees, the Polish government has sent tanks and jet fighters to Kyiv, while many other countries refused to send such equipment, the material notes. And now the sharp change in rhetoric towards Ukraine seen recently may not be understood by PiS supporters. “The risk is that PiS voters generally support pro-Ukrainian policies and such a rapid change in policy will be difficult to explain,” said the head of the Institute for public relations of the analytical center in Warsaw, Jacek Kucharczyk, whose words are quoted in the article. It is also noted that the conflict between Warsaw and Kyiv over blocking the supply of Ukrainian grain undermines the main foreign policy victory of the current government of Poland, Gazeta.Ru reports. After many years of bitter conflicts with the European Union and other key allies over the rule of law, media freedom and backsliding on democratic standards, Ukraine's strong support has changed perceptions of Warsaw in Brussels and Washington. Now this has been called into question, the authors of the article pointed out. In Poland, the next parliamentary elections are scheduled for October 15. Five against one: farmers in EU countries are against the import of grain from Ukraine The influx of cheap agricultural products interferes with their own supplies. Relations between Warsaw and Kyiv have worsened due to Warsaw’s extension of the embargo on the supply of Ukrainian grain, lifted by the European Commission on September 15. After this, Deputy Head of the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine Taras Kachka announced a retaliatory measure to Poland’s gesture. He threatened to impose an embargo on some Polish vegetables in the coming days. In addition, Kyiv filed a lawsuit with the WTO against countries that banned the import of Ukrainian agricultural products. On September 20, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that Warsaw will expand the food embargo if Kyiv continues the escalation. At the same time, he announced the cessation of supplies of any weapons to Ukraine. Later it became known that Poland would send Ukraine only weapons previously agreed upon for supplies. Candidate of Political Sciences, Associate Professor of the Department of Political Analysis, Faculty of Public Administration, Moscow State University. M.V. Lomonosov Alexander Konkov, in a conversation with Izvestia on September 21, noted that Poland’s statements regarding the embargo on the supply of Ukrainian agricultural products, as well as restrictions on the transfer of new weapons to Ukraine, should be considered in the context of the upcoming elections in the country.

"December 2023","American authorities have assessed the risk that Ukraine will be defeated in a conflict with Russia without additional assistance from the United States as high. White House Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby announced this on December 6. Thus, he commented to reporters on the failure of the American Congress to make a decision to provide additional assistance to Kyiv. “There is a great risk that Ukraine could lose,” he said during a press conference, which was broadcast on YouTube. He also said that the White House had rejected Republican demands for tighter control of the US southern border, which had previously been put forward as conditions for continued aid to Ukraine. “We know that there is bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress, but we have been deceived a number of Republicans who want to hold Ukrainian support hostage by [demanding] a number of pretty radical border measures,” he said. Joe's points: the US President published a policy article on Ukraine and Palestine Biden outlined key points on current conflicts Earlier, on December 4, White House Budget Director Shalanda Young reported that the United States would run out of funds to help Ukraine by the end of this year. According to Young, the inaction of American parliamentarians “threatens Ukraine, not only jeopardizing the successes achieved by Ukraine, but also increasing the likelihood of Russian military victories.” In mid-November, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, during a visit to Kiev, announced that the United States would provide Ukraine receives a new tranche of military assistance worth $100 million. At the same time, the Russian Ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, called the new package of military assistance to Kyiv a calming pill. He pointed out that the situation at the front and in the Ukrainian government is on the verge of collapse. On November 17, US President Joe Biden signed a bill to finance the work of the country’s government without assistance to Ukraine. The temporary funding bill was approved by both houses of the American Congress and also does not provide for assistance to Israel.

The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on March 2 that the German authorities are engaged in investigation into the leak of a recording of a conversation between German officers, and called this situation a very serious problem. Bild reported then that Graefe was to blame for the incident because he connected to the conversation from Singapore through an unsecured network, creating a threat to the security of the conversation. The Ukrainian side is attempting to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 of the year. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, since, according to him, this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

This is how the businessman reacted. in response to the words of journalist Matt Walsh, who on his page also condemned the situation with migrants in the country. He emphasized that everything necessary to ensure border security is already concentrated in the hands of US President Joe Biden.

On January 29, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said that the US state authorities want to place barbed wire along its entire border. He explained this by the fact that previously more than 3 thousand migrants crossed the border per day. According to him, after the construction of the barriers, this figure became zero.

"19 September 2023","The NATO countries made a big mistake when they pushed Ukraine to start a conflict with Russia. This opinion was expressed on Saturday, September 16, by columnist for the Spanish portal Rebelión Maria Mercedes Blanco Reyes. The author of the article indicated that the story with Ukraine is coming to an end, since NATO countries do not have enough resources not only to help Ukraine, but also to ensure the security of the alliance.“ The Ukrainian conflict has convincingly demonstrated that NATO is not capable of defending even its own territory,” Reyes emphasized. She added that sending weapons to Ukraine, although it entailed the depletion of NATO reserves, still did not bring success to the Ukrainian side, ultimately turning out to be completely useless for Kyiv, and for the West. “This does not bode well for NATO. The fact is that Ukraine initially did not have sufficient Air Force and, in principle, should not have participated in hostilities, but NATO, especially the United States, brought it to this armed conflict,” Reyes concluded. Exhaustible reserves: Russian Armed Forces strike at enemy rear Destroying Storm Shadow missiles reduces the intensity of Ukrainian shelling, experts note On September 18, it was reported that American political scientist Malek Dudakov suggested a refusal on the part of the United States to supply long-range ATACMS missiles to Kyiv. Dudakov expressed the opinion that such a decision was made by Washington due to its reluctance to incite a conflict with Russia. Before this, on September 17, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov expressed the opinion that Western countries, led by the United States, are waging a war against Russia by supplying weapons to Ukraine and ammunition, as well as supplying Kiev with intelligence data.

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on November 13 that it is becoming more difficult to finance the provision of Ukraine with what the US considers necessary with every week. The reason for this is the refusal of the House of Representatives of Congress to allocate additional funds for these purposes. On November 10, retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Earl Rasmussen told Izvestia that Ukraine is aware of the complete failure of its counteroffensive, which the West forced to launch.

As a result of such actions, the debt only continues to grow, and the country is “giving away enterprises to Western creditors for free,” the observer added.

Meanwhile, he called this the same new norm as preparations for impeachment. “As for the current lack of agreement on assistance to Israel and Ukraine, the fact is that when it comes to the functioning of the state on a temporary budget, some expenses are simply not there.” “, the political scientist explained. According to him, these expenses are absent only during the approval period, this does not mean at all that they will not appear later. Meanwhile, according to the expert, disputes between various political forces are fraught with a suspension of government work. “This is simply a temporary cessation of the work of some non-vital budgetary institutions,” Byshok noted.

The columnist believes that the Ukrainian crisis has reminded us of the need to build long-term strategies, as was the case during the Cold War. He emphasized the importance of comparing the country's strengths with the weaknesses of the enemy. According to Nelson, the Russian leader is well aware of the danger of impatience that democracies have, since they usually prefer to choose very quick options. As the journalist noted, only support from the United States and other Western countries will allow Kyiv to confront Russia. However, he pointed out that America is not particularly inclined to help Ukraine. Nelson called this approach incorrect and called for people to start “playing for the long haul.” Complete shutdown: in the United States there is a threat of a government shutdown By the end of the month, Congress must formulate a budget for the next fiscal year.

In addition, the head of the committee called on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to make clear statements on the topic of supplying cluster munitions to Kyiv at the upcoming summit in Vilnius. Along with this, Hofreiter emphasized the power of the Russian armed forces, noting the strong front line. Call and not offend: the West is thinking about how to properly refuse Ukraine They don’t want to see the country as part of NATO Earlier in the day, ex-US intelligence officer Scott Ritter said that supplies of cluster munitions to Ukraine will make this country’s army less effective than when they were used conventional high-explosive fragmentation shells. On July 7, US Presidential National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that Washington would transfer cluster munitions to Kyiv. According to him, Kyiv gave guarantees that they would be used responsibly. In turn, the Russian Ambassador in Washington Anatoly Antonov called the decision to supply cluster munitions to Kyiv as a gesture of desperation on the part of the United States. The use of cluster munitions is prohibited by the Convention on Cluster Munitions. It came into force on August 1, 2010, it was signed by 123 countries, but ratified by only 110. Of the European countries, the convention was not signed by Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Greece, Georgia, Latvia, Poland, Russia, Romania, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine, Finland and Estonia. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the decision of which was made after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"16 December 2023","Law enforcement officers in the uniform of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), accompanied by people in camouflage, visited restaurants in Kyiv and Krivoy Rog to hand out summonses to visitors. This was reported by the Ukrainian publication Strana.ua on Friday, December 15. The material explained that videos of raids in public catering establishments appeared on social networks. Thus, in one of these videos, filmed in the Kiev restaurant “Veranda on the Dnieper,” you can see a man with the inscription SBU on his sleeve. Why SBU representatives take part in the raids is unknown, but they appear accompanied by people in camouflage. According to the publication, similar visits were observed by visitors to at least four other restaurants. “Suddenly, 25–30 people appear, and everyone’s documents begin to be checked. This actually started yesterday and is an extremely alarming signal on the eve of New Year’s corporate events, when restaurants raise their main annual revenue. No one has yet explained the reason, intentions and consequences,” Strana.ua quotes a source as saying. The raids began on Friday, when establishments were filled with visitors more than on other weekdays. “Now they are handing out summonses to staff and guests,” one of the restaurateurs told the publication. Meanwhile, the SBU explained to Strana.ua journalists that employees are thus taking security measures against possible sabotage. In restaurants, as they said, service workers are accompanied by units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Migration Service. “As part of the inspections of public institutions, which are taking place for the third day in a row, persons potentially involved in illegal activities are being checked. At the same time, TCC representatives are conducting checks on Ukrainian citizens liable for military service who may violate military registration rules,” the publication quoted its source in the SBU as saying. They set the agenda: how a new stage of mobilization will take place in Ukraine. The Rada expands the rights of military registration and enlistment offices, conscripts kiss the “trees of freedom.” Earlier, on December 15, representatives of the military registration and enlistment offices descended on the gym in Odessa. The Strany.ua article stated that this is not the first case. Raids on sports clubs happen regularly in Ukraine. Customers even began to return or transfer their subscriptions for free. Earlier, on December 11, a member of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, Solomiya Bobrovskaya, said that Ukraine failed to mobilize, and the recruitment of the republic’s army occurs on a quantitative, not qualitative basis. Before that , December 8, Advisor to the Head of the Office of the Ukrainian President Mikhail Podolyak said that a new wave of mobilization in Ukraine will be difficult. As Podolyak noted, the Ukrainian authorities are currently developing a new program of mobilization activities, and are also reviewing approaches to recruiting new citizens into the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). On November 8, the Verkhovna Rada supported the bills of the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky on the extension of martial law in the country and general mobilization until February 14, 2024. Martial law in Ukraine has been in effect since February 2022. At the same time, the country's President Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization. Later, the Verkhovna Rada repeatedly extended its validity. Most men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country. The special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"February 2024","Employment of Ukrainian refugees in Germany has failed. The German newspaper Bild reported this on February 4. According to January data from the employment agency, on average only 1.2% of unemployed Ukrainian women were able to find work over the year, which is 0.5% less than in January 2023. The share of unemployed Ukrainian men fell by one point, to 2.4%. Three months ago, Labor Minister Hubertus Heil launched the Job Turbo program aimed at integrating refugees into the labor market so they can find work faster. “So far this has not been successful, on the contrary “,” the publication notes. According to Daniel Terzenbach, an employee of the Job Turbo department of the Federal Employment Agency, the reason for this drop is the “weak German economy.” According to forecasts of the Federal Employment Agency, in 2023 the number of working-age Ukrainians should increase by 50 thousand people, because even more Ukrainians have arrived in Germany. According to the agency, 835 thousand refugees from Ukraine of working age from 15 to 65 years live in Germany, 64% of whom are women. As of January, a total of 417.5 thousand Ukrainians were looking for work. The newspaper adds that instead of the benefits provided for asylum seekers, Ukrainians in Germany are entitled to unemployment benefits. Therefore, the bloc of the Christian Democratic and Christian Social Unions (CDU/CSU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) call for providing Ukrainians with only benefits for asylum seekers, that is, a maximum of €410 instead of €563 per month. Hole on the border: Kyiv intends to draft Ukrainian refugees into the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Ukrainian authorities are looking for ways to return men liable for military service from Europe President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky on January 31 said that the assistance from Western countries that they provide to Ukrainian refugees should be sent directly to Kyiv. He said that it would be much better if Germany supported Ukrainians by giving money to the budget of Ukraine, otherwise this money also remains within the European states. Earlier, on January 26, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called on employers to help with employment for Ukrainian refugees in the country . He noted that about 80% of Ukrainian citizens are a qualified workforce, which, despite the language barrier, could be used in the labor market. On December 23, 2023, chief correspondent for the German Focus magazine Ulrich Reitz said that the return of military-age citizens to Ukraine would be meet the interests of Germany. According to him, fewer Ukrainians work in Germany than in other countries, as they use benefits. For this reason, he called on the country’s authorities to rethink their policy towards refugees. European countries began to host Ukrainian refugees on their territories since the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which Moscow announced on February 24, 2022.

"May 22 2023","Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergei Ryabkov on May 22 called the assertions that Western countries, unlike Russia, are taking a responsible approach in the nuclear sphere, inadequate. “Such statements are inadequate. They reflect the general anti-Russian and anti-Chinese tone, which became the leitmotif of the summit of the so-called “Group of Seven,” says Ryabkov in a widespread comment regarding statements issued following the events of the G7 countries. Ryabkov also emphasized that the Russian Federation considers the military-biological activity of the West in the post-Soviet space as a threat to its national security. “Uncontrolled by anyone, the extremely dangerous military-biological activities of the United States and its allies outside national territory require the closest attention of the entire world community. We consider such activity of Western countries, including in the post-Soviet space, as a real threat to the national security of the Russian Federation and other states - first of all, those on whose territory it is carried out,” the diplomat said. At the same time, according to him, the Russian Federation is in nuclear is transparent and acts in a responsible manner. Guarantees and dangers: the Russian Foreign Ministry named the conditions for a return to START-3 What Russia expects from the United States to continue the dialogue on arms control and what Washington is ready for Earlier, on May 4, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in a conversation with Izvestia, that the United States is conducting dubious military-biological activities not only in Ukraine, but also in other post-Soviet republics. The Russian Foreign Ministry told Izvestia on April 17 that Russia would welcome the conclusion in the future of a comprehensive treaty that would include all countries that have nuclear weapons. February 21 In his message to the Federal Assembly, Putin announced Moscow’s unilateral suspension of participation in New START. The president called the decision forced because nuclear-armed countries continue to develop their weapons and demand access to Russian nuclear facilities. Under the Strategic Arms Treaty, which Moscow and Washington signed in 2010, countries are required to exchange comprehensive databases on the status of warheads. However, at the end of March, US Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy John Plum said that Washington, in response to a similar decision by Russia, would no longer transfer key data about its strategic nuclear forces to Moscow.

"February 2024","Russia has irrefutable evidence that the Il-76 plane with Ukrainian prisoners was shot down by an American Patriot anti-aircraft missile system (SAM), which means that the United States is an accomplice in the terrorist attack. This was stated on February 6 during a meeting of the UN Security Council by Russia's permanent representative to the organization Vasily Nebenzya. “Today we have irrefutable evidence that the Patriot air defense system was used to carry out the strike, which leaves no doubt that Washington is a direct accomplice and this crime,” he said.

The other day, an unnamed French official told the Associated Press that, according to the French military, the plane was shot down from a Patriot air defense system from a distance of about 50 km,” said the permanent representative of the Russian Federation. Once again he called on the members of the Security Council and the UN leadership to strongly condemn all terrorist attacks by the Kyiv mode.

He stated this on Friday, June 23, at a press conference in Moscow. Naryshkin pointed out that the preconditions for the modern conflict can be counted from the coup d’etat in Ukraine and from the beginning of Kyiv’s military operations against the residents of Donbass in 2014. He also recalled that Kyiv did not comply with the concluded Minsk agreements. In addition, the events of the end of 2021 showed that former Western partners do not agree to Moscow’s proposals to create a security regime on the European continent, the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service added. According to him, Russia has received enough data that Kyiv has concentrated serious forces around Donbass in order to finally “strangle” it. “After the special military operation began and as a result of the actions of our military, documents were discovered indicating that, indeed, Kyiv was planning with the consent or even with the prompting of their Western masters at the end of February - beginning of March (2022 - Ed.) to begin, in fact, a punitive operation, which was supposed to lead to casualties on the part of the residents of Donbass,” he said. “Neither the West nor the Kyiv regime needs peace in Ukraine” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin on the risks of further NATO expansion to the east and negotiations with Ukraine Earlier, on June 19, Naryshkin said that Washington and London agree to turn Ukraine into a “black hole” » Europe.

"24 January 2024","The conditions for ending the conflict in Ukraine and its timing will be determined not in Kyiv, but in the West. This assessment was voiced on January 24 by a member of the Russian delegation at the negotiations in Vienna on military security and arms control, Yulia Zhdanova. “Any unbiased person already understands that it is not Ukraine, but its curators who will decide when to stop and start talking seriously about realistic conditions for completion conflict. In the meantime, as we see and hear here, the West is not interested in starting negotiations,” she said at a plenary meeting of the OSCE Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC). The diplomat also pointed out the reason for the statements of London and a number of former high-ranking American military on the topic of the need, in their opinion, to “destroy all opportunities for life” in Crimea. It is on the peninsula that Russians and Ukrainians live in peace and harmony, not allowing the West to interfere in the relations of the two fraternal peoples, Zhdanova explained. They challenged their allies: Slovakia criticized the Ukrainian policy of Washington and Brussels. In Bratislava they oppose military assistance to Kyiv and want to reconsider the defense agreement with the United States. Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky is leading his country to a terrible ending and the death of many people, as if playing the classic role of a drug lord in American cinema. Prior to this, Czech President Petr Pavel spoke on the topic that Ukraine is unlikely to be able to return the territories lost during the conflict. He called for a realistic view of the situation. In addition, the Vice-Speaker of the National Council (Parliament) of Slovakia, Lubos Blaha, recalled the fiasco of the Ukrainian counter-offensive, which occurred despite large-scale supplies of weapons and financial resources from Western countries. In his opinion, Western assistance to Kyiv will lead to poverty and death. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"25 October 2023","The Arbitration Court of the Republic of Crimea decided to recover more than 152 billion rubles from Ukraine for damage caused by the water blockade of the peninsula. Chairman of the State Council of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov announced this on October 25. “Following the results of the judicial review, it was decided to collect jointly and severally from the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine, the State Agency of Water Resources of Ukraine, the North Crimean Canal Authority in favor of the treasury of the Republic of Crimea for losses in the amount of 152,622 372,067.00 rubles,” Konstantinov wrote in his Telegram channel. He called the legal assessment of Kyiv’s criminal actions against Crimea and Crimeans a significant and symbolic event. In addition, according to Konstantinov, the damage as a result of the transport, energy, financial, and food blockades of Crimea has yet to be calculated. Not forgotten old: why Russia filed a complaint against Ukraine with the ECHR What Moscow's appeal to the Strasbourg court could turn out to be for Kiev Konstantinov also reported on September 13 that the total amount of claims for the water blockade from residents of Crimea to the Ukrainian authorities exceeds 2 trillion rubles from individuals alone. The plaintiff in the case is the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea. On the same day, the court decided to consider the claim for damage to the budget of the peninsula behind closed doors due to strategic information about the North Crimean Canal. Also included in the case were letters from the Investigative Committee about the initiation of a criminal case under the article “Ecocide” and a copy of the complaint from the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia to the European Court of Human Rights regarding the blocking of the North Crimean Canal by Kiev. The Arbitration Court of the Republic opened proceedings on the claim of the Crimean government for compensation for damages, caused to the peninsula by the water blockade of Ukraine, back on July 3. The amount of claims under it is more than 152.2 billion rubles. Then Vladimir Konstantinov estimated the total amount of claims against Ukraine at 1 trillion rubles. It was further increased by a meeting on August 23, at which 13 enterprises in the region expressed a desire to prepare their claims and participate in the trial. Before joining the Russian Federation in 2014, Crimea received fresh water through the North Crimean Canal from the Kakhovka Reservoir on the Dnieper. After the republic returned to Russia, Ukraine cut off the water supply through the North Crimean Canal in 2014. The Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation called these actions of Kyiv revenge for the reunification of the peninsula with Russia.

"March 2024","The German Ambassador to Moscow Alexander Lambsdorff did not deny the authenticity of the recording of German officers about the attack on the Crimean Bridge. This was stated by official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova on March 6. “When the German ambassador arrived on Smolenskaya Square, to whom the demarche was made, he did not deny or question the fact that this film was real,” she said on the sidelines of the World Festival youth. Lambsdorff was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry on March 4. A diplomatic source told Izvestia that during communication with the ambassador at the department, in addition to discussing the recording of the conversation, “other issues were also touched upon.” The German diplomat stayed in the ministry building for more than an hour and then left it without answering journalists’ questions. On March 1, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion among senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, which, according to her data, took place February 19. During the conversation, the military discussed the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine. “Scholz will have to remove Pistorius from office” Member of the Bundestag Herold Otten - about the scandal in the Bundeswehr, the arms lobby in Germany and the conflict between the Russian Federation and NATO In a fragment of an audio recording of representatives of the German Air Force, officers discussed how many of these shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether there would be such a strike effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr Inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the authorities are promptly investigating the situation around publication of a recording of a conversation between German officers in Ukraine. He indicated that what happened was a “very serious problem.” Later, Bild reported that Graefe was to blame for the leak of the conversation, since during the conversation he was in Singapore and connected through an unsecured network. Later, on March 4, Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov noted that the recording of conversations between German officers demonstrates the involvement of Western countries in the conflict in Ukraine. In addition, Moscow hopes to get acquainted with the results of the investigation of the German authorities on this topic, Peskov said. The Ukrainian side is making attempts to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, as this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"11 June 2023","Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia on the basis of any peace initiatives, including those proposed by Brazil, Indonesia and African countries, are impossible. This was stated on Sunday, June 11, by Mikhail Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. “Any negotiation process with the current Russian government is impossible. There are no Indonesian, Brazilian or African “grounds” for this at all,” the politician wrote on Twitter. He also called such initiatives dangerous and “murderous” for Ukraine and Europe. Earlier this month, Indonesian Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto held two separate meetings with ambassadors Russia and Ukraine according to his proposed peace plan. The initiative includes, inter alia, a ceasefire, the creation of a demilitarized zone and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force. The Russian Foreign Ministry, in turn, noted the similarity of Indonesia’s plan with the Minsk agreements. Shortly before this, African countries, led by South Africa, declared their readiness to submit their peace plan for consideration by Moscow and Kyiv. Contacts in this area have already taken place. Brazil and China have also proposed their initiatives for a peaceful settlement. Thus, Brazil’s plan suggests that Ukraine should not lay claim to Crimea. In addition, it is proposed to create a group of countries that are not directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine and could find a way to resolve it peacefully. The Magnificent Six: African countries will send negotiators to Russia How the states of the continent plan to reconcile Moscow and Kyiv The Kremlin, for its part, said that Russia does not see the prerequisites for resuming dialogue with Ukraine. Thus, presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov drew attention to the fact that there are more and more expert discussions about the peace process, but they do not take into account Moscow’s goals. He also noted that the goals of the special operation stated by Russian President Vladimir Putin have not changed and must be achieved. The last face-to-face round of negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine took place on March 29, 2022 in Turkey. Later, Kyiv officially refused contacts with Moscow. Russia continues a special operation to protect Donbass, whose residents refused to recognize the results of the 2014 coup in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister of Slovakia emphasized that he does not care according to which peace plan they end. In his opinion, Russia and the United States should agree on this, since “Ukrainians do not play any role here.” On October 25, Slovak President Zuzana Caputova officially appointed a new government of the republic headed by the leader of the Course - Social Democracy (Smer) party Fico. According to the results of the elections to the national council (parliament) in Slovakia on September 30, the government coalition, in addition to the Fico party, was formed by the Voice - Social Democracy party and the Slovak National Party.

The Financial Times reported this on July 3, citing sources. According to them, this plan was allegedly proposed by Moscow during negotiations mediated by the UN. “The new organization will be allowed to use the global financial messaging system SWIFT, which was closed to the largest Russian banks “, the publication says. As the publication notes, this option for preserving the Black Sea initiative is perceived by its supporters as “the least worst.” Sources cited by the newspaper noted that the European Union has struggled to agree on measures to ease sanctions on specific Russian companies or allow them to export certain goods to third world countries. The interlocutors also stressed that EU officials are currently assessing whether how legal and feasible this proposal is. Grain mark: The EU does not plan to reconnect Rosselkhozbank to SWIFT Could the West’s reluctance to comply with Russian demands lead to the abandonment of the Istanbul agreements The international payment system SWIFT stopped servicing Rosselkhozbank in June last year due to anti-Russian sanctions. Reconnecting the bank to the system was one of Russia's conditions for extending the grain deal. The EU, in turn, stated that this cannot be done before the end of the conflict. As Peter Stano, the official representative of the EU foreign policy service, told Izvestia, Brussels can soften or even lift sanctions only after the end of the Ukrainian conflict. The grain deal was extended until July 18, but Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 13 allowed a withdrawal from the Black Sea initiative because, according to him According to him, Russia's interests are not taken into account, and nothing has been done in terms of liberalizing grain supplies. Later, on June 20, the coordinator for strategic communications at the White House National Security Council, John Kirby, said that the US authorities hope to extend the grain deal and are going to provide support UN and Turkey on this issue. Then, on June 21, the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov said that there were no prerequisites for extending the food deal. The food deal was concluded on July 22, 2022 in Istanbul.

According to her, Western countries began to prepare the situation in Ukraine in the last century, after the Second World War: at that time, while the Soviet Union was fighting the gangs and collaborators who remained in that territory, “the West only threw them there.” And after the 1990s, this work only intensified. “Power in 2013–2014 passed by force into the hands of pro-Western elements. And then began the story of the culmination of liberal democracy, which fell into a bloody peak,” Zakharova emphasized. They challenged their allies: Slovakia criticized the Ukrainian policy of Washington and Brussels. Bratislava opposes military assistance to Kyiv and wants to reconsider the defense agreement with the United States. The day before, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Washington is not interested in dialogue to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. At the same time, Russia is ready to listen to anyone who is sincerely interested in justice in Russian-Ukrainian relations, the head of the Foreign Ministry emphasized. This approach implies an end to the US policy of using Kyiv as an instrument of war against Moscow, he explained. At the same time, Assistant US Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Celeste Wallander said that Ukraine’s European allies continue to support it, despite the US lack of funds for military assistance to Kiev .On January 22, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said during a speech at the UN Security Council that the so-called peace formula of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and other similar initiatives are a path to nowhere. He added that the West's continued support for the Kyiv regime is a key factor preventing a diplomatic solution to the conflict. Earlier, on January 17, First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs Svetlana Zhurova said that the United States was delaying the process of peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine due to personal gain. In her opinion, they will try to leave the situation in a sluggish process, so that there is time to “remove the Russian Federation as a competitor, building relations with Europe on energy resources, and so on.” In October, former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder said that in 2022 it was possible would put an end to the Ukrainian conflict if not for geopolitical interests. As the politician noted, at the peace negotiations in Istanbul, the Ukrainians did not agree to peace because the United States did not allow them. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 by the Russian President after aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"30 September 2023","Republicans predicted a two-week break in funding for the US government. The Washington Post reported this on September 29. “Republicans in the House of Representatives privately admit that the government shutdown could last at least two weeks,” the publication writes. According to journalists, pressure on the House will increase as everyone expects that the shutdown will end before military personnel receive their salaries in mid-October. “Most Republicans do not want a government shutdown, but have difficulty approving any compromise budget projects for a short period,” the publication writes. It is also noted that in the event of a shutdown more than 820 thousand federal employees will be sent on unpaid leave, that is, they will not be able to go to another job, although wages will not be transferred. Complete shutdown: in the US there is a threat of a government shutdown By the end of the month, Congress must formulate a budget for the next fiscal year On September 23, the US government began preparing for a possible shutdown that could happen if legislators cannot agree on an extension of funding. If no resolution is reached, millions of government and military workers will not be paid, and federal programs - from some food safety inspections to child care funds - will come to an abrupt halt. On the same day, US President Joe Biden called on members of the Republican Party to prevent US government shutdown. He stressed that the government shutdown will affect everything from food security to children's education programs. The American leader called on the Republicans to return to the budget issue. Commenting on these events, American political scientist Malek Dudakov told Izvestia that the suspension of the US government will lead to a reduction in aid to Ukraine. In his opinion, Biden has no way to avoid a shutdown - this process will happen automatically on October 1. However, as the Americanist noted, this will not lead to any immediate disaster for the American government. On September 26, US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy called on the American president to personally intervene in the situation with the impending shutdown due to the lack of general agreement on the adoption of the country’s interim budget. He also noted that it would be very important to hold a meeting with Biden to prevent a government shutdown.

"18 December 2023","In the US, Texas Congressman Tony Gonzalez said that US lawmakers will have to sweeten the deal between the Senate and the House of Representatives on aid to Ukraine and funding for border security. He shared his opinion on December 17 in an interview with CBS News. According to him, in order to gain the number of votes necessary to allocate aid to Kyiv in exchange for promoting a bill to tighten immigration legislation, supporters of support for Ukraine will need to “soften the deal.” As Gonzalez noted, In the Senate, which is very different from the House, a battle is expected to reach 60 votes. In the House of Representatives, the battle for the required 218 votes will take place. “The Senate is very different from the House of Representatives. The Senate is about to fight for 60 votes. The House faces a fight to get to 218. We can do it. But we will have to soften the deal,” he said. The politician indicated that this “softening” includes recognizing the cartels as terrorist organizations and bringing smugglers to justice. In his opinion, this could help “bring the score to the finish line” and get the 218 votes needed to allocate aid to Ukraine in the House of Representatives. The cherished dose: the United States decided not to rush to help Ukraine Zelensky personally flew to Washington for weapons and money, but there is almost no chance of getting them On December 6, Republicans blocked the Senate from considering the White House request for funds for Ukraine, Israel and other needs. In exchange for concessions on the bill, they demand changes in approaches to border protection. On December 10, the White House announced that the United States had $1 billion left to replenish its own arms stocks, which are depleted due to regular deliveries to Ukraine. In this regard, Congress was called upon to approve the White House's request for an additional $60 billion to help Ukraine. Opposition from the Republican Party slowed down the process, since most of the discussed assistance to Ukraine “stays at home.” On December 14, White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby reproached Republicans for leaving Ukraine without assistance by going on New Year’s holidays and not coordinating the request for a new package of military assistance. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kiev against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by the Russian President on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce support for Ukraine.

"24 November 2023","The number of Ukrainians who are ready to sacrifice territories for the sake of peace with Russia is growing. Bloomberg writes about this on November 24, citing survey results. “Zelensky (Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky - Ed.), may not yet be thinking about the strategy of peace negotiations. However, polls show that a small but growing minority of Ukrainians come to believe that territorial concessions to Russia may be the inevitable price for peace,” the agency reports. The publication notes that the situation on the battlefield for Kyiv has changed little over the year, and Ukrainian the authorities are disappointed that their allies underestimated the power of the Russian defense lines. Support from Western countries also does not help Ukraine, the authors of the article point out. Moreover, according to European officials, Kyiv's allies are preparing for a scenario in which this support could decrease. “We shouldn’t expect a complete settlement of the Ukrainian crisis in the near future” Political scientist Denis Denisov on the situation in Ukraine Earlier, on October 18, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukraine needs to lift the decree prohibiting negotiations if it wants to begin the negotiation process. He noted that if earlier Kyiv declared the need to inflict a strategic defeat on the Russian Federation on the battlefield, now Ukrainian politicians have begun to point out the importance of holding peace negotiations. Zelensky on November 20 opposed holding peace negotiations with Russia, despite the difficult situation of the Ukrainian army. He indicated that he ruled out friendship with the Russian Federation. Later, on November 22, Putin recalled that the Russian Federation had never refused peace negotiations on Ukraine. According to him, any military action is always a tragedy, and it is necessary to “think about how to stop this tragedy.” The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced on February 24 last year, continues.

"26 November 2023","Secretary of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence Roman Kostenko said on November 25 that Ukraine would develop a law that would increase the powers of employees of territorial recruitment centers (TMC) (military registration and enlistment offices). “In fact, the TCC has no rights to stop a person, hand over give him a subpoena, demand documents from him. The police sometimes distance themselves from this so as not to be at the center of a scandal, so as not to involve a person,” he said in an interview with Radio NV. As Kostenko noted, the bill will be developed with the participation of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff by the end of the year. Evasion and punishment: how a new stage of mobilization is taking place in Ukraine They want to send students, female doctors and disabled people to the front Earlier, on November 13, in Uzhgorod, 68-year-old clergyman of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) Dmitry Sidor received a summons. As the priest noted, he is already under house arrest. According to media reports, a criminal case has been opened against Sidor for inciting sectarian hatred. On November 12, the Strana.ua publication wrote that in Ukraine, military registration and enlistment office employees detained a bus driver who brought children to a taekwondo competition from Vinnytsia region to Uzhgorod, and handed him agenda. He was immediately sent to a commission, and after that to the Chernigov training center, his phone was taken away and he was not given the opportunity to inform his family and coaches about what had happened. The national police of the Sumy region reported on November 8 that the driver of a car at a checkpoint beat a military registration and enlistment office employee who was trying to give him a summons. A criminal case was opened under the article “Threat or violence against an official or citizen performing a public duty.” On September 23, a 55-year-old citizen of Ukraine called the Dobroslav police and reported that his daughter’s husband had been hiding from the military registration and enlistment office for six months and was ignoring summonses. He passed on the coordinates of his son-in-law and asked to send employees of the territorial detention center to the place. On September 18, it was reported that the Lvov Regional TsK would conduct an inspection after reports of the forcible detention of a man at the military registration and enlistment office. The Ukrainian publication ""Strana.ua"" wrote on September 13 that students in Ukraine those receiving a second higher education began to be handed summonses. A captured Ukrainian Armed Forces militant said on September 4 that in Kyiv it is shameful and dangerous to walk the streets in military uniform. According to him, civilians are afraid that a person in uniform is bringing them a summons, so they can “hit them with a bottle.” On September 3, it became known that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense issued an order according to which they would call up men with limited fitness for military service. Before that, on August 1 , member of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Sergei Tsekov told Izvestia that Ukrainians began to understand that they were fighting not for their freedom, but for the interests of other states and individuals. This is how he responded to the words of the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Alexander Pavlyuk, that the problem of evading mobilization has worsened in the country. Martial law in Ukraine has been in effect since February 2022. At the same time, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization. Later, the Verkhovna Rada repeatedly extended its validity. Most men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country.

Politico reported this on Friday, October 6, citing a government source. “The outgoing bureaucratic government of Slovakia will no longer send military equipment to Ukraine,” the publication reports.

They didn’t lose Fico: how the victory of the opposition will change the politics of Slovakia How the elections in the republic ended and who will join the ruling coalition Earlier, on October 4, Slovak President Zuzana Caputova announced the need to stop aid to Kyiv until parliament convenes. The country's Ministry of Defense planned to transfer a new aid package to Ukraine, but Chaputova did not support this decision. She noted that it is necessary to respect the results of democratic elections and wait for the formation of a new coalition. Earlier, on October 2, Denis Denisov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, told Izvestia that the victory in the elections in Slovakia of the opposition party of ex-Prime Minister Robert Fico Smer could have an impact to help Ukraine from many European countries. Elections in Slovakia were held on September 30. As a result, the Smer party won. The center-left faction of Robert Fico received 22.94% of the electoral votes as a result of the vote. Prior to this, on September 26, Fico said that the country's army was in a deplorable state after the transfer of military equipment to Ukraine.

"12 April 2023","Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has named the United States as one of the three main opponents of his Fidesz-Hungarian Civil Union political party, underscoring the depth of the long-standing rift between Washington and the NATO member. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote about this on April 11, with reference to classified American materials that were publicly available on the Internet. It is noted that, according to documents, the statement was made by Orban at a political meeting in February. “In the updated CIA intelligence information, dated March 2, it is said that Mr. Orban’s inclusion of the United States as the main opponent at the political strategy meeting on February 22 “represents an escalation in the level of anti-American rhetoric,” the publication says. Also, the Hungarian prime minister, the author of the article added, named two more the main opponents of their party. However, no further details are provided. March theses: Orban spoke out against American interference in EU politics. The Hungarian Prime Minister again reproached Brussels for impotence. The leak of two large batches of secret Pentagon documents became known on April 6. We are talking about about 100 documents that relate to the combat capabilities of Kyiv, NATO support and the vulnerability of the Ukrainian army. Earlier that day, the head of the office of the Hungarian Prime Minister, Gergely Gulyas, answering a question from journalists regarding the difference between Budapest’s relations with Washington and Moscow, said that Hungary's economic ties with Russia are broader due to historical reasons. On April 5, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said that Budapest does not support any NATO decisions that could provoke a direct conflict between the North Atlantic Alliance and Russia. Prior to this, on March 9, the Hungarian Prime Minister said, that the restoration of relations between Russia and Europe after the end of the conflict in Ukraine is necessary, but “far from reality.” And although maintaining contact with the Russian Federation is important for Hungary, it will have to adapt to the new geopolitical reality.

"30 November 2023","The declaration adopted by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the inadmissibility of holding elections in the country during martial law is a test step to see the reaction of the West. Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor of the Russian State University for the Humanities Tamara Guzenkova told Izvestia on November 30. “From my point of view, this is a kind of trial step. This is not yet a legislative initiative, it is a kind of declaration that demonstrates the general mood of parliamentarians, and in fact, legislators, but does not have rule-making legislative consequences. And it seems to me that in this way the Ukrainian parliament took a tentative step to see how the so-called international community would react to this,” says Guzenkova. She emphasized that Ukraine’s internal policy today is not independent in nature and is under strong influence and strong pressure Washington. According to Guzenkova, we should not forget about the extremely difficult economic, social and demographic situation that is now unfolding in the country. “From my point of view, this declaration and, in general, all the noise that is being made around this event is another attempt to divert the attention of potential voters, and their own public from what is actually happening to them,” the political scientist concluded. Self-deception and theft: The West is changing its attitude towards Zelensky. The Ukrainian president began to be scolded by the American media. Earlier on Thursday, deputies of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine signed a declaration on the inadmissibility of holding elections in wartime. According to the document, presidential elections will be held no earlier than six months after the lifting of martial law. According to information provided by the Strana.ua publication, the Ukrainian authorities expect that the declaration could become “an additional obstacle to the implementation of the scenario of “elections before the end of the conflict.” In early November, Zelensky said that in the current situation, holding presidential elections in Ukraine would be an untimely event . He also urged everyone to focus on defense issues and work in unity. At the same time, he previously noted that he was ready to run for a second term. Zelensky was elected to the post of head of state in the spring of 2019. Ukraine has been under martial law since February 2022.

He noted that the missile that hit the market in this locality was launched from the Ukrainian direction. “You don’t need to be a ballistics expert to base this on available video materials posted by users on social networks and, by the way, even by [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky himself, to see that the missile arrived from the north-west, where exclusively Ukrainian positions are located,” the diplomat emphasized.

This was reported by retired General of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Sergei Krivonos. “The situation in Kupyansk has been discussed more than once, back in November I drew the attention of the public and the Ukrainian leadership to the fact that it is necessary to monitor what is happening in the Kupyansk direction, because the Russians are fighting with mathematical precision, in the sense that they are studying all the options and calculating the possibilities,” he said on the YouTube channel “Direct” on February 8. As Krivonos noted, the Armed Forces of Ukraine risk losing control over the Kupyanskaya railway in this area - a major transport hub that allows increasing the effectiveness of the transfer of military personnel throughout the front line. The retired Ukrainian general emphasized that the unstable economy of the republic could deprive the army of necessary weapons and ammunition.

"24 September 2023","Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are eliminating the ATACMS operational-tactical systems that the United States plans to transfer to Ukraine as soon as they are on the front line. Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson said this on September 24 on the Dialogue Works YouTube channel. “They (ATACMS. - Ed.) will not change the balance on the battlefield. Their range is 190 miles, approximately 260 km. These missiles can only hit deep into Russian territory if they get close to the front line. The closer they are to the front line, the more vulnerable they will become, and then they will be destroyed by Russian drones,” Johnson explained. The expert added that Kyiv’s Western allies are confused because they expected the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) to defeat Russia, which they did not happened. The day before, military expert Yuri Knutov, in a conversation with Izvestia, said that the United States is supplying the Ukrainian Armed Forces with a limited number of long-range ATACMS missiles due to doubts about the effectiveness of these weapons during a special operation.

The day before, the coordinator for strategic communications at the White House National Security Council, John Kirby, noted that the next weeks and months will be critical for Ukraine, so the United States of America will try to provide Kiev with everything it needs. He assured that Washington’s military support to Kyiv will continue on a full scale. Earlier in April, it became known about Spain’s plans to supply six Leopard tanks to Ukraine by the end of the month. Madrid will also transfer 20 armored personnel carriers to Kyiv. In mid-March, it was reported that the first 10 Ukrainian crews completed training in working with Leopard tanks in Spain. The trainings were held at the national training center in Zaragoza. Moscow has repeatedly condemned Western arms supplies to Ukraine and the training of the Ukrainian military in the West, noting that this leads to an escalation of the conflict and makes NATO countries a participant in it. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background special operation of the Russian Federation to protect Donbass, the decision of which was made against the backdrop of aggravation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"December 2023","The fighter jets supplied by NATO to Ukraine will be a legitimate target of the Russian Armed Forces. The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, stated this on December 6 during a briefing. “For the Russian armed forces, fighters participating in the conflict on the side of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, no matter where they fly from, will be a legitimate target for destruction,” she said. Zakharova noted that Taking into account the fact that most of Kyiv's airfield infrastructure has been destroyed, the use of airfields outside Ukraine is not excluded. The risks of a direct military clash between Russia and NATO are only increasing, she added. Finger to the sky: what will the transfer of F-16 fighters to Ukraine lead to? Kyiv may receive the first batch of aircraft before the New Year. European countries plan to begin transferring F-16 fighters to Kyiv in the first quarter of 2024. At this time, Ukraine hopes to receive 19 aircraft from Denmark. Subsequently, the Netherlands and Belgium also promised to supply aircraft to Kyiv. According to some reports, by 2025, Ukraine may receive at least 61 fighter jets from partners. On November 20, First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexander Pavlyuk said that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has created a separate structure, “Office-61,” which will deal with the integration of the F-16 into the country’s Air Force . According to him, among the main tasks of this unit are the support and development of airfield infrastructure, the protection of airfield infrastructure and much more. Speaker of the Air Force of Ukraine Yuriy Ignat also announced the start of training for Ukrainian pilots to fly the F-16 in Denmark. According to him, training for them also takes place in the USA and Great Britain. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022. The decision to launch it was made due to the aggravation of the situation in the region as a result of shelling by Ukrainian troops.

"12 October 2023","The Russian military is able to liberate Kharkov within a few days. This assumption was expressed by former Pentagon adviser Douglas McGregor on October 12. “The main question is what the Russians are going to do. If they wanted to launch an offensive and immediately liberate Kharkov, this could be done within a few days,” he said in an interview with the Judging Freedom YouTube channel. McGregor noted that the United States can only guess why the Russian Armed Forces (RF Armed Forces) have not yet begun such actions, although “they are able to carry it out.” He also added that the Ukrainian army is on artificial life support. “We supply it with almost everything. We pay them to bureaucrats, we pay them to military personnel,” the ex-adviser concluded. Scattered flights: a kamikaze drone factory was destroyed in Kharkov A precise strike could permanently eliminate the threat of mass use of some types of drones. Before this, on October 9, Colonel McGregor said that Russia would liberate Kharkov and Odessa, and the United States would not be able to do anything about it. According to the colonel, from the very beginning of the special operation it was clear that the Russian side would take control of two historically Russian cities. In addition, he recalled that Russia has already liberated part of the regions that have been its territory since the time of Catherine II the Great. Earlier, on September 30, former US Armed Forces intelligence officer Scott Ritter noted in his forecast that Ukraine will lose five more regions before completing conflict with Russia. He added that the Russian military would also liberate Odessa, Nikolaev, Dnepr, Kharkov and Sumy. At the same time, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said that Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass would continue until the complete destruction of the Kyiv regime, and there would be new regions within the Russian Federation more. On September 28, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that Ukraine will be occupied if it agrees to surrender. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues.

This was stated by American journalist and Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh in an article on the Substack platform. “[Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky has no other plan than to hold on. It’s as if he were an orphan - a poor street kid in his underwear, and we don’t have the slightest real idea of what Zelensky and his entourage are thinking about,” the American official told the journalist. In addition, according to Hersh, the official noted that the administration of US President Joe Biden allegedly played an important role in both attacks on the Crimean bridge, which occurred in 2022 and July 2023. According to him, the drone technology belonged to Washington. Burning summer: The UAF has already lost 311 tanks in attempts to attack. What other losses are Ukrainian formations suffering in the Northern Military District zone? The day before, Newsweek, citing Western experts, reported that NATO countries were responsible for the failure of the UAF counteroffensive. The magazine writes that the alliance moved up the timing of the offensive and for this reason did not have time to prepare the Ukrainian military. On July 23, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the failure of the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian troops. He voiced this conclusion during negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko. On July 21, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky himself admitted that the counteroffensive was going very hard due to the slow supply of weapons to Kyiv from Western countries. According to the Ukrainian leader, the Kyiv authorities did not calculate the time required to prepare a counteroffensive. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which the Russian leader announced on February 24, 2022, continues.

"July 2023","It is absolutely impossible to restore Ukraine's energy system by the next heating season. Most likely, it will be possible to repair only 15%. This opinion was expressed on July 5 by the director of the Ukrainian Center for Energy Research, Alexander Kharchenko. He noted that the promise made by the Kyiv authorities at the end of last winter about the readiness to restore almost 80% of the country’s energy facilities is technically “virtually unrealistic.” “If 20 are restored by the heating season %, then it will be very good. I think it will be somewhere around 15%,” the RBC-Ukraine agency quotes Kharchenko. At the same time, the expert believes that this will be enough to cover the current needs of the Ukrainian energy system for transporting electricity at least for a while. Kharchenko explained that there is regions where energy problems are greatest, for example the Kiev and Odessa regions. There are still power outages due to unreliable operation of existing equipment. He emphasized that until new systems arrive from the West that should replace the temporary solutions found, “nothing can be done fundamentally.” Dark affairs: why the Ukrainian energy sector will never recover In Kyiv, they announced a huge shortage of electricity. Earlier, on June 20, the national energy company Ukrenergo reported that 43% of the main networks in Ukraine were damaged in six months. They noted that the infrastructure is in critical condition, and the ability to switch consumers to backup power schemes has been reduced. Chairman of the Board of DTEK Kiev Electric Grids Vladimir Kudritsky stressed on May 25 that the summer season will be difficult for the country’s energy system due to a lack of resources. According to estimates of the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine , to restore the republic’s energy system in 2023, $3.4 billion will be required. On April 3, Igor Yushkov, a leading analyst of the National Energy Security Fund, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, told Izvestia that in Ukraine today mainly Soviet energy equipment is used. The expert noted that some were damaged during the fighting, some were destroyed, and some were simply outdated. Therefore, Kyiv, according to Yushkov, will carry out a comprehensive modernization of the electric power industry at the expense of Europe.

"12 September 2023","The statement by former CIA agent Andrew Bustamante that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has no choice but to negotiate with Russia is somewhat premature. One should not expect that negotiations can take place in the near future, Denis Denisov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, said in a conversation with Izvestia on September 12. Bustamante made a corresponding statement the day before in an interview with the YouTube channel Stephen Gardner. He noted that the Ukrainian leader realized that he could not continue to talk about the victory of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). According to him, Ukraine is perceived as an unreliable country and the time has come for Zelensky to think about how he is going to negotiate with Russia. Denisov, in turn, called statements of this kind somewhat premature,” since, in his opinion, Ukraine and Zelensky at this At this stage, it is not in a completely hopeless situation. “Financial support from the collective West continues, and armament with military equipment continues. Based on this, I don’t see any prerequisites for building exactly such a logic,” he noted. If support begins to decline significantly, then Zelensky’s room for maneuver will narrow and he will have to negotiate with Russia on the conditions that Moscow puts forward, the political scientist believes .“There is quite a lot of time before the onset of conditions conducive to Zelensky entering into negotiations with Russia, moreover, on Moscow’s terms. And this is well understood in the USA and a number of European countries. Based on this, we can hardly expect in the near future that such a configuration will actually arise and such negotiations will take place,” Denisov concluded. The sum of the differences: what to expect from further negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine And why assessments of the progress of consultations by Moscow and Kiev do not coincide On September 10, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Ukraine will meet halfway, as soon as Russia makes a proposal for peace negotiations. However, he noted that due to Russia's inflexible position, the likelihood of negotiations remains minimal. The next day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov at the WEF recalled that Vladimir Putin had repeatedly said that Moscow was ready to achieve its goal through diplomatic means. He pointed out that it was the Ukrainian side that left the negotiating table with Russia. In addition, more efforts are coming from Moscow to resolve the conflict. Speaking at the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF-2023) in Vladivostok on September 12, Putin said that if Kyiv is ready for negotiations with Moscow, let him say so himself. The President emphasized that Russia cannot stop hostilities unilaterally and watch the enemy advance. First of all, he said, Kyiv itself must demonstrate interest in resuming the dialogue. The last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, Turkey on March 29, 2022. They lasted about three hours. Later, in October, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow.

Continuous genocide and terrorism,” he said on his Redacted News program. Morris expressed the opinion that only an “uneducated person” would not connect the current events and the shelling of Donbass civilians that began in 2014. The Ukrainian crisis began nine years ago, he added. Attacks on civilians by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), the journalist noted, continue. So, recently, the presenter said, the Ukrainian Armed Forces struck Donetsk and the Zaporozhye region, targeting residential areas where there are no military installations.

Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Galushchenko announced this on November 10 in an interview with the Politico newspaper after a meeting with officials from the administration of US President Joe Biden and American legislators. “Responding [to Russia’s attack], we would respond with the same approach, attacking their energy infrastructure,” he responded. Galushchenko answered a question from journalists about whether Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky could target Russian energy facilities in response to similar attacks in Ukraine. According to Galushchenko, this would be fair. In an interview with the newspaper, Galushchenko also pointed out that he is not a Ukrainian military personnel and has not discussed such attacks with U.S. government officials. Shock week: damage was caused to the rear infrastructure of Ukraine The purpose of regular attacks on such facilities is to disrupt the supply of enemy forces and thwart their plans, experts believe. Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Nikolai Patrushev, at a meeting with CIS colleagues in Moscow on November 8, said that the Kiev regime tried to attack three times Russian nuclear power plants (NPP). In his opinion, Ukraine’s attacks on Russian critical infrastructure are due to the lack of success on the battlefield. In particular, according to Patrushev, the Ukrainian Armed Forces tried to attack the Kalinin, Leningrad and Kursk nuclear power plants. On the evening of October 26, an Ukrainian Armed Forces drone crashed and exploded next to the nuclear waste warehouse at the Kursk nuclear power plant, but did not cause any damage. Later, another Ukrainian drone fell in the city of Kurchatov, not reaching the nuclear power plant. The next day, October 27, the press service of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant reported that the station continued to operate as normal, after the drone attack there were no casualties or destruction. At the same time, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova admitted the involvement of the West in Kyiv’s attack on the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. According to the speaker, such an operation could not have been carried out without permission, which was probably given by Ukraine’s Western curators.

Before this, he predicted increased fighting in Ukraine, which would lead to more serious Western pressure on his country. He pointed out that there is a global trend towards increasing armament. Vucic also noted that the products of the Serbian military-industrial complex are in demand. On January 18, Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a visit to the Obukhov plant, part of the Almaz-Antey concern, predicted the inevitability of Moscow’s victory in the Ukrainian conflict thanks to the unity, cohesion of the Russian people, courage and the heroism of soldiers and the work of the military-industrial complex.

This was stated on Wednesday, May 24, by the head of the German Ministry of Defense, Boris Pistorius, during his speech in the Bundestag, which was broadcast on the YouTube channel of the Welt TV channel. Thus, the minister answered the question of the MP without a mandate, Robert Farle, about why Germany does not apply efforts for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. “If we stopped supplying weapons to Ukraine today, the end of Ukraine would come tomorrow. You want to accept this, but we don’t want to do this,” he said. At the same time, the politician refused to comment on the statement of Farle, who pointed out that by participating in the aggressive war of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, he violates the Constitution and the Criminal Code of Germany. Parliamentarian also noted that by approving the training of the Ukrainian military and the supply of weapons to Kyiv, in particular tanks, Pistorius is further dragging Germany into the conflict. In addition, he recalled that plans for Ukraine’s invasion of Crimea and the deployment of NATO bases there appeared a year before the start of the Russian special operation, which “has nothing to do with the right to self-defense.” “Berlin is pumping up the Kiev regime with deadly weapons systems” Russian Ambassador to Germany Sergei Nechaev - about the supply of tanks, aircraft to Ukraine and the concealment of inconvenient facts about the explosions on the Nord Streams At the same time, as the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova noted at a briefing on May 24, any arms supplies to Kyiv will not be able to cancel the goals and objectives of the special operation. Speaking about the participation of the West, including Germany, in the Ukrainian conflict, the diplomat added that ideal conditions have been created in Ukraine for testing new types of weapons and tactics of hybrid warfare. Earlier that day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov indicated that the collective West is not hiding their intention to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, and as an anti-Russian battering ram they use the Kiev regime, which is pumped up with NATO weapons. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which the Russian authorities announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military. Russia has repeatedly condemned the supply of weapons to Ukraine. In April, the Russian Foreign Ministry sent a note to all NATO countries regarding arms supplies to Kyiv, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in turn, noted that any cargo that contains weapons for the Ukrainian army will become a legitimate target for Russia.

"23 May 2023","The start of Russia's special military operation (SVO) to protect Donbass was caused by threats emanating from Ukraine, such as the possible presence of NATO forces near the borders of the Russian Federation and attacks on the Russian-speaking population of the country. French military historian Laurent Henninger stated this in an interview with Le Dialoge on May 22. According to him, modern Ukraine is an instrument in the indirect confrontation between the West and Russia. At the same time, the historian pointed out that the Russian Federation is weakening the Ukrainian army on the battlefield, depleting its ammunition and destroying its borders. To explain the psychological aspect of this conflict and the mental components of the Russian people, the expert mentioned that Russian President Vladimir Putin pays special attention to the memory of the USSR victory in World War II war and refers to the historical memory of Russians who lost tens of millions of lives in the largest military conflict in human history. “We have been seeing this in Russia for many years. In particular, we see parades of the “Immortal Regiment”, when thousands of people annually take to the streets with the St. George flag, ribbon, red flag, <...> portraits of fathers, grandfathers, great-grandfathers,” he noted. In his opinion, the reason is that the Russians still “have an approach and understanding of the long game that Westerners no longer have.” Pre-emptive strike: why Russia suspended participation in the New START Treaty The United States insists on Russia's return to the treaty, fearing an arms race Earlier, on March 7, former US officer and political scientist Scott Bennett, in a conversation with Izvestia, noted that NATO and the European Union (EU) took excessive advantage of the good by the will of Russia, which led to dire consequences. According to the expert, Western countries often resorted to lies, betrayals and manipulations that were beneficial to the United States. All this led to a coup in Ukraine in 2014 and the genocide of the Russian population of Donbass.

"28 December 2023","Director of the International Institute of New States, Alexey Martynov, suggested in a conversation with Izvestia on December 28 that the United States will gradually freeze funding for Kyiv due to a complete loss of interest in the Ukrainian conflict. The day before, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington would provide Kyiv with the last package this year assistance for $250 million, adding that there will be no new tranches until Congress approves the allocation of a new amount of money for this purpose. “I would like to draw your attention to the fact that each time the figure is getting smaller. At first there were hundreds of billions, then tens of billions, then billions, now a couple of hundred millions. That is, this is a clear negative dynamic - the loss of interest and ability of the [US President Joe] Biden administration to spend money on this meaningless story. I think the United States will continue to support, at least while Biden is at the helm. But I assume that little by little they will freeze all aid,” Martynov believes. According to him, today the Ukrainian case is clearly toxic for Biden, and the money provided to Ukraine could have been spent on more useful things for the Americans themselves than ""throw them down the drain."" Fools are tormented: the West has run out of money and weapons for Ukraine Countries that most actively support the Zelensky regime are forced to solve their own political and financial problems Earlier, on December 21, Blinken said that Washington’s continued support is crucial for Kyiv. He also said that the United States has a clear plan for the development of Ukraine without the financial support that the country has to provide now. Prior to this, on December 19, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller announced the impossibility of providing assistance to Ukraine bypassing the US Congress. According to him, Washington does not have a “magic pot” from which it could draw assistance to Kyiv without a congressional decision on additional funding. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which began on February 24, 2022 due to for the aggravation of the situation in the region as a result of Ukrainian shelling.

"December 2023","President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky has recently suffered only setbacks and is in a very difficult situation on all fronts. The American magazine Newsweek wrote about this on December 6. Journalists note that Western countries began to refuse to send additional military assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), and the country’s army was not making any progress. “After Bulgaria refused to transfer 100 units of armored vehicles to Kiev, it became clear that trouble does not come alone, if we talk about the bad luck of Vladimir Zelensky,” the material notes. Against this background, Russia is only becoming stronger, and the Ukrainian leader is beginning to be strongly criticized by opposition forces in the country. “Very difficult times await Ukraine. Both the elites and society in the West are tired of the conflict,” the authors concluded. Coup or resignation: what will the conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny lead to? Experts told details of political intrigues. Earlier on December 6, Business Insider noted that Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers fighting on the front line feel abandoned. As one of the Ukrainian military men noted in a conversation with a journalist, the Armed Forces of Ukraine believe that their presence at the front had more political than military significance. On the same day, the head of the press service of the American State Department, Matthew Miller, at a regular briefing said that the United States would exhaust funds to support Ukraine. He emphasized that the United States administration has already used more than 97% of the funds allocated to finance the Kyiv regime. Prior to this, on November 27, it was reported that dissatisfaction with the generals, the government and Zelensky personally was growing in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces pointed out the “imprudence” of the country’s leadership, and also stated the absence of a communication system between neighboring units in the army. They noted that each department has to fight for itself. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"March 31 2023","Even if Ukraine raises enough funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other financial institutions to finance its economy, Kiev will face the question of a debt repayment mechanism that will cost the country dearly. The Economist reported this on March 30. IMF loans are expensive - more expensive than those from other donors, the publication says. Ukraine, as a middle-income country, must pay a base interest rate of 3.5%. Each time a payout is received, the fund charges an additional half a percent for administrative costs. And since Ukraine borrows so much, it is responsible for the additional costs. These payments are intended to ensure that countries do not demand more from the fund than they need, notes Gazeta.Ru. It is clarified that it is difficult to predict the future of any collapsing economy. “Ukraine needs economic support, but its allies had to take the risk, and not the IMF,” says Mark Malloch-Brown, an employee of the Open Society organization. In his opinion, the Kyiv regime should be provided with grants, and not allow Ukraine to accumulate funds in debt, which will ultimately be extremely expensive. As the publication reminds, the country’s GDP fell by 30% in 2022; a growing budget deficit forced the central bank to print billions of hryvnia and devalue the currency. The country is due to receive $15.6 billion from the IMF over the next four years under an emergency program that could be approved by the Fund's board of directors next week. In the deep trench: why the IMF mission started working in Ukraine In Kiev, they dream of loans, but they don’t want to fulfill the fund’s demands. Earlier, on March 29, it was reported that Canada will provide Ukraine with an additional loan through the IMF for $1.76 billion. The money will go to help Ukrainians in providing necessary services. The funds will be allocated from the IMF’s “administered account for Ukraine,” which already holds about €2.8 billion, which were allocated by the United States, Canada and other allies of Ukraine. On February 21, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said that Ukraine will be in vital need of external financing not only this year, but also in subsequent ones. Prior to this, on February 17, the fund’s press service reported that the IMF had reached an agreement with Kiev regarding monitoring the economy, which allows us to move on to discussing a full-scale lending program for the country.

Thus, he commented on Facebook (belongs to the Meta organization, recognized as extremist in the Russian Federation) on messages about the union’s plans to put pressure on the Hungarian economy in in the event that Hungary does not make concessions on the issue of further support for Kyiv. “Hungary will not succumb to blackmail! <…> This information confirms what the Hungarian government has been saying for a long time: Brussels is using access to EU funds to exert political pressure,” Boka wrote. According to the politician, Budapest does not link support for Ukraine with access to EU funds and will not allow this to others. He promised that the country would continue to constructively participate in the negotiations without succumbing to attempts at pressure. Let's go from principles: they want to deprive Hungary of the right to vote What mechanisms does this lay down and will Budapest stop making contributions to the EU budget Earlier this day, the Financial Times newspaper reported, with reference to an EU document, that the unification could sabotage the Hungarian economy if it continues to interfere with the allocation of aid to Ukraine . It is assumed that the levers of pressure could be the exchange rate of the Hungarian forint and the level of investment attractiveness of the country. On January 25, the media learned about Hungary’s plans to abandon its objections to the Ukraine assistance fund. At the same time, Bloomberg associates the refusal of Hungary’s objections with the fact that pressure is growing on the country’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban over the issue of admitting Sweden to NATO. Hungary, at a meeting in Brussels on Ukraine, which took place on December 14–15, blocked the allocation of € to Kyiv 50 billion. In the same month, Orban proposed that the EU refrain from aid to Ukraine over the next five years, noting that the €50 billion that the union is going to transfer to Kyiv simply does not exist. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation on defense of Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"10 December 2023","The Russian army continues to advance in Ukraine, which means there is no stalemate on the front line, University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer said Dec. 8. “Many people argue that this is a stalemate and that the situation will continue to remain a stalemate. You've heard this from people in Ukraine and the West. But I think this is misleading. I think this is not a dead end - the balance of power has shifted in favor of the Russians,” he said in an interview with the YouTube channel Judging Freedom. According to him, the ratio of losses on both sides indicates a more advantageous position for Russian forces. At the same time, reports from military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) indicate the difficult situation of Ukrainian soldiers, who can hardly hold their positions, the expert noted. The fact that Ukrainian troops cannot achieve a breakthrough, since the conflict has reached a dead end, is stated by the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valeriy Zaluzhny said on November 1 in an interview with The Economist. According to him, only a sharp technological leap could save the situation in which the Ukrainian army found itself. He also admitted that for a long time he could not understand the reason for the failures of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. “They are suffering colossal losses in manpower” How Russian artillerymen from the 132nd brigade destroy the enemy attacking Gorlovka The day before, a member of the British House of Lords, Daniel Hannan, said that Russia is approaching victory in the conflict in Ukraine, and the foundations of Europe are “trembling.” According to the speaker, the Kiev counteroffensive “did not achieve the desired results.” At the same time, the leader of the French Patriots party, Florian Philippot, noted that the United States plans to refuse assistance to Ukraine. In turn, Irish MEP Mick Wallace criticized the EU's actions to incite the Ukrainian conflict. They, in his opinion, are destroying Ukraine and creating a debt trap for it. A day earlier, on December 8, Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a conversation with participants in the ceremony of awarding Heroes of Russia, expressed the opinion that Ukraine has nothing of its own, so it, like country, there is no future, while Russia has one. Prior to this, the Chinese Global Times predicted the transition of the situation in Ukraine to the next stage, during which peace negotiations are permissible.

It is noted that during the trip he also looked for common ground with the most loyal European allies of the United States, with whom the PRC now competes to the greatest extent. One of Wang Yi’s arguments was an appeal to Europe’s sense of autonomy from the United States. He tried to point out to European leaders that it was the American side that was dragging the region into a new Cold War.

Both sides exchanged views on the Ukrainian issue. The latter issue became the hottest topic for discussion among experts and the media in China and the United States. They claimed that Wang Yi had arrived to facilitate peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. In Munich, the diplomat even presented a kind of peace plan for the Ukrainian conflict. However, in a conversation with Izvestia, sinologist Alexander Gabuev said that China, which Western elites are actively criticizing for supporting Russia, in practice does not distance itself: trade is growing, military exercises are taking place, relations between the two countries are strengthening and deepening. But in order to not be scolded so much by the Europeans and to drive a wedge between Europeans and Americans, it is beneficial for the Chinese to emphasize that they are for peace. The tour of the head of Chinese diplomacy began on February 14. He visited France, Italy and Germany, where he spoke at the Munich Security Conference.

FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov said this on Wednesday, October 11. “In EU countries alone, 17 training camps operate under the patronage of NATO intelligence services. Westerners are actively promoting the movement of militants into the Ukrainian conflict zone.

"25 December 2023","Military expert, director of the Museum of Air Defense Forces Yuri Knutov said that a way to combat the new AQ-400 Scythe drone, which Ukraine presented, could be the use of the new Russian Pantsir-SM air defense system. In a conversation with Lenta.Ru on Monday, December 25, the specialist noted that the “Scythe” drone is made of plywood, its body shape is like that of a Storm Shadow missile. The wings are also plywood, the engine is gasoline, and it is equipped with modern NATO electronics. This drone can fly a distance of about 750 km, its payload weight is 42 kg. The expert added that this drone can be launched in a swarm of up to nine pieces, one of which will be a commander drone that controls the rest. Such a drone is launched both from a catapult and from a wheeled chassis. Knutov noted that it was planned to produce 100 drones per month, and by the end of the year - up to 500, writes NSN. This forces Russia to think even more seriously about its means of defense. According to Knutov, the new Pantsir-SM air defense system, already tested in a war zone, can help with this. “Four small missiles, the so-called flying nails, can be launched from one tube; they are specifically designed to combat drones.” “, the expert explained. He pointed out that such missiles can be both conventional and hypersonic, capable of shooting down ballistic missiles. A complex without a station will receive instructions from a vehicle with a station; it is possible to connect several systems to it. “Such a battery is able to repel the attack of a large number of drones,” the expert concluded. Size and significance: the new mini-radar will warn of drone attacks. Together with electronic warfare systems, it will be able to protect entire areas on the line of combat contact from drones. As noted by the 360 TV channel, the Pantsir-SM complex began to be produced in Russia back in 2019. It is designed for the defense of military and civilian facilities, including long-range air defense systems. The head of the management department of the Specialists Training Center, Yuri Andronov, in an interview with the Zvezda TV channel, called the Pantsir-SM a kind of symbiosis of a combat and transport-loading vehicle.

They also stated that the American authorities are encouraging the Ukrainian diaspora to interfere with the work of Russian diplomats and the intelligence services are trying to recruit employees of foreign institutions. “Raider seizures of diplomatic property, non-issuance or issuance with incredible delays of visas, including to members of official delegations to participate in UN events , regular refusals to travel beyond the 25-mile zone, encouragement by the authorities of the radical Ukrainian diaspora to carry out offensive actions that complicate the work of Russian foreign institutions,” the commentary says.

This was stated on May 10 by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Greece, Dimitris Koutsoumbas, during a televised debate of the leaders of parliamentary political parties on the eve of the elections in Greece. “The arms supply agreements that Greece has concluded with France, the United States and other countries serve the interests of NATO, which includes Greece.

"September 2 2023","Western states need to agree on a workable plan for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. This was stated on Friday, September 1, by British military historian, writer and former military intelligence officer Frank Ledwidge in a commentary for The Guardian. He emphasized that the counter-offensive of Ukrainian forces did not bring the desired results, which means that a more realistic goal should be chosen and efforts should be joined. . Otherwise, the current crisis may drag on for several more years. At the same time, the expert continued, a new plan for achieving peace does not necessarily have to meet all the requests and requirements of Kyiv without exception. “Recently, the director of the personal office of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Stian Jenssen, suggested that Western diplomats are beginning to consider the possibility of exchanging Ukrainian territories for membership in the alliance,” Ledwidge noted. He pointed out that due to the risk of nuclear escalation, there are almost no people willing to help Ukraine in the “return” of Crimea. Be silent and listen: Ukraine is dissatisfied with the rhetoric of Western media. In Kyiv, criticism from allies was painfully accepted.

"10 June 2023","The Russian army's repulsion of offensive attempts by the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) showed the high quality of training of Russian troops. This opinion was shared on June 9 by retired NATO officer Stavros Atlamazoglu in an article for the Sandboxx portal. He noted that since the summer of 2022, Russian forces have created one of the most extensive defensive lines in recent history. “Russian fortifications consist of defensive lines of anti-tank trenches, pillboxes, anti-vehicle barriers, pre-fixed artillery, drones and large minefields,” the officer continued. According to Atlamazoglu, Western countries clearly underestimated the Russian troops, who were well prepared for attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The specialist shared a photo showing disabled German Leopard tanks delivered to Kyiv 2A6 and American M2 Bradley. He emphasized that the military equipment was blown up in minefields and is unsuitable for further use. The officer also noted that the Ukrainians will not be able to effectively resist Russian artillery due to the lack of air supremacy. The Armed Forces of Ukraine with the latest Western equipment have to take risks in the open field. “Already at the initial stages of the Ukrainian counter-offensive, it is clear that Ukraine is dealing with a truly professional Russian army,” the officer concluded.

Prior to this, on December 20, it was reported that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were experiencing an acute shortage of ammunition and drones in the special operation zone. Former President of the country Petro Poroshenko noted that there was a shortage of such weapons, while there were “tens of thousands” of them in special warehouses.

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel said this on April 30 at the book fair in Leipzig. “It is important for me, and I have always tried, that we do not narrow our horizons too much [in searching for a solution to the conflict in Ukraine],” ZDF TV quoted her as saying. Merkel also urged not to “immediately boo” those who offer diplomatic options for resolving relations between Moscow and Kiev. She also pointed out that people who support negotiations do not necessarily support the point of view of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Earlier in the day, Merkel said that she had made every effort to prevent a conflict between Moscow and Kiev. She also emphasized that the Minsk process was a reasonable step that could contribute to the resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine after the events in Crimea in 2014. At the same time, the politician noted that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky did not believe that the Minsk the agreements must be implemented. In turn, the adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, Mikhail Podolyak, criticized Merkel for her words about attempts to prevent a military conflict between Moscow and Kiev. He noted that the ex-chancellor, receiving cheap gas from the Russian Federation, made the whole of Europe dependent on Russian energy. In December 2022, Merkel said that the purpose of the Minsk agreements was an attempt to give Ukraine time to build up its forces in the confrontation with Russia. According to her, all countries participating in the Minsk agreements understood that the conflict in Ukraine was only suspended, and the problem itself was not resolved.

As Ryder indicated, the United States has about $1 billion left to help Ukraine. Washington plans to allocate them by the end of the year.

"18 September 2023","Russia will not retreat from its goals during the special operation to protect Donbass. Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson said this on September 17. “Russian President Vladimir Putin expects to contain Ukraine until it is forced to either surrender or enter into peace negotiations on Moscow’s terms. There will be no situation where Russia will retreat, there is simply no chance,” he said on the Dialogue works YouTube channel. Johnson noted that Putin is seeking to avoid an escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, since expanding the crisis and involving Western countries in it would result in a disaster. The former intelligence officer also said that he had high hopes for Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky that he would be able to resolve the conflict, but in the end he only exacerbated the confrontation. “He betrayed the Ukrainian people: I remember how during the election race he promised to improve relations with Russia and end the Civil War,"" Johnson said. Starting point: the Russian Armed Forces continue to repel attacks in the Donetsk direction Already in early October, the Ukrainian Federal Unity will be forced to go on the defensive, military experts are sure. Earlier, on September 6, retired US Armed Forces officer Daniel Davis said that Zelensky’s desire to continue hostilities at any cost will ultimately lead to victory of the Russian Federation. In his opinion, Russia cannot lose, since it has decisive technical and demographic superiority. Earlier, on September 4, the US Congress announced Ukraine’s loss in the confrontation with Russia. It was also pointed out that there is a direct relationship between the Western sanctions policy towards Russia and the risk of a weakening dollar. Before this, on August 31, the US Congress pointed out the danger of prolonging the conflict in Ukraine for decades if the United States does not stop sponsoring hostilities. The solution to the problem was the refusal to finance Kyiv and the direction of US funds to solve the country's internal problems.

"August 2023","The famous Ukrainian counteroffensive does not actually exist. However, the Kiev regime, being a hostage to the demands of the West, cannot stop this suicidal unsuccessful campaign, as stated by the French colonel, participant in conflicts in Africa and Europe and winner of many military awards, Jacques Augard. “NATO, which is responsible for this conflict, is pushing the regime [ President of Ukraine Vladimir] Zelensky and his armed forces to a military adventure. This famous counteroffensive does not exist in reality. We saw only a few tactical maneuvers that immediately failed,” the expert explained in an interview with Stratpol on August 4. He cited a number of reasons why Ukrainian fighters are physically unable to resist Russian forces. As Jacques Augard pointed out, these factors can be expressed in numbers. “First, the troops are exhausted. The number of soldiers is constantly decreasing, and everyone knows about it, but the West prefers to remain silent about it. Secondly, the technology is running out. The West now supplies much less equipment. The only useful thing that the West continues to supply is intelligence information,” said the military expert. It is in this regard, against the backdrop of the lack of success of Ukrainian militants, that the Kiev regime is attempting to attack peaceful Russian cities using drones, noted Jacques Augard. Kyiv cannot resist Russia, and it has no choice but terrorist attacks on peaceful territories. Ukraine could have avoided all the destruction, the expert emphasized. To do this, in 2022, she should not have obeyed the West, which wanted to start a war with Russia. It is because of this that Ukraine has become a battlefield between Russia and the NATO bloc. “I think that this “support” of the West is in fact extremely hypocritical. In March 2022, Mr. Zelensky was ready to discuss negotiations. <...> We see with great bitterness that fraternal peoples are divided by Western intrigues, primarily American and NATO,” the expert is confident. The expert also notes that an increasing amount of money from ordinary European taxpayers is spent on supporting Ukraine due to the appetite of the Kyiv regime , which now cannot be appeased. “Zelensky is now uncontrollable, demands more and more money and more and more weapons, but for what? For a victory that is obviously slipping out of Ukraine's hands? I think that all moral responsibility for such an outcome lies on the shoulders of the West,” adds Ogar. “Vladimir Zelensky’s goal is to drag European nations into the conflict” Member of the European Parliament Thierry Mariani - on the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, the Nord Stream explosions and Macron’s African tour Earlier, on August 5, Saudi Arabia organized a meeting of national security advisers and representatives of several countries to discuss the Ukrainian crisis. The Russian Federation was not invited to the negotiations. On August 7, the permanent representative of the Russian Federation to international organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, called the negotiations in Jeddah a meaningless event. Ulyanov noted that real politics in international relations is being replaced by PR and propaganda events, and the meeting in Jeddah was an example of this. At the end of July, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov indicated that it is now impossible to reach a peaceful resolution of the conflict with the participation of the Kyiv regime.

A round-the-clock blockade was introduced on November 27. On the same day, Lviv Mayor Andrei Sadovoy called on Poland to immediately end the “shameful blockade” of the border with Ukraine. He noted that all the positive actions of Warsaw for Kyiv are negated by a “group of marginalized people” who are blocking the supply of humanitarian goods. On November 19, it was reported that in Ukraine, interruptions in the delivery of some goods began due to the blocking of the border. At the same time, the vice-president of the Association of International Road Carriers (ASMAP) Vladimir Balin said that Kyiv and Warsaw intended to sue over problems with blocking traffic at the border. In early November, carriers from Poland began to block road checkpoints on the border with Ukraine. They demanded the introduction of commercial permits for Ukrainian carriers and limiting their number. Because of this, huge queues of trucks have accumulated at the border. Truckers later announced that the protest action would continue until February 1 next year.

"November 2023","The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaliy Klitschko, against the backdrop of the Verkhovna Rada’s adoption of a bill on the redirection of personal income tax from military income from local budgets to the country’s budget, said that the Ukrainian authorities have failed to finance the army. He wrote about this on November 8 in his Telegram channel. “By taking away the military personal income tax from cities and settlements, the Verkhovna Rada and the government demonstrate that the central government has failed to finance the army. And now he is trying to transfer this to local government. This is despite the fact that all cities already pay 40% of their communities’ personal income tax to the state budget. And Kyiv - 60%,” the politician indicated. In his opinion, the adoption of the draft law will hit small cities hard, as they will lose a significant part of the budget. Earlier that day, the chairman of the budget committee of the Ukrainian parliament, Roksolana Pidlasa, said that the Verkhovna Rada Ukraine, in the second reading, adopted a bill that would redirect personal income tax from military income from local budgets to the country’s budget. The Verkhovna Rada also supported the bills of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky on the extension of martial law in the country and general mobilization until February 14, 2024.

"16 February 2024","Helping Kyiv is Washington’s national interest. This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Olga Stefanishyna. Her words were quoted by Bloomberg on February 16. “Politics is politics, but protecting democracy around the world is the national interest of the United States. And we hope that this interest will be a priority,” she said. Also, as the Deputy Prime Minister noted, the lack of funding for Ukraine in the past few months has hit the liquidity of the country’s budget and its ability to build military plans. According to her, the Kyiv government is working on “Plans B and C” in case the funding gap continues. “We are engaged in contingency planning on our part,” Stefanishina said. To spite Trump: NATO may begin to coordinate assistance to Ukraine instead of the United States Western countries are thinking about revising the mechanism for distributing military supplies to Kyiv The US Senate on February 13 approved assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan in the amount of $95 billion. At the same time, The Guardian noted that the project has little chance of passing approval in the House of Representatives, as US House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized it for the lack of provisions put forward by Republicans to stop the record flow of migrants on the border with Mexico. US President Joe Biden on the same day said he was confident of a positive result in the House vote representatives of the full US Congress regarding this bill. He called on Johnson to allow the House of Representatives to express their opinion. At the same time, the head of the US Treasury, Janet Yellen, indicated that budgetary support for Ukraine from the United States is more important to the Kyiv regime than ever before. In her opinion, the allocation of additional funds to Kyiv will be an “assurance” to all other donors that Washington will continue to support along with other Western countries. At the same time, on February 15, the US House of Representatives, without voting on the bill to help the three countries, went into recess and will return to work only on February 28. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022. The decision to hold it was made by Russian President Vladimir Putin against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to the aggression of Ukrainian troops. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce aid to Kyiv.

"31 March 2023","Countries that previously held a neutral position towards Russia began to move closer to it. The American television channel CNBC reported this on Thursday, March 30, citing a study by the Economist Intelligence Unit. “The number of countries actively condemning Russia has decreased from 131 to 122. The bloc led by the United States and the European Union, including pro-Western countries, represents about 36 % of the world’s population,” the report states. Experts included countries such as China, South Africa, Mali and Burkina Faso as leaning towards Russia. Together they make up 33% of the world's population. The report also records an increase in the number of neutral countries, including Turkey, Colombia and Qatar. Experts believe that in the mentioned countries an opinion is emerging about the West’s hypocritical approach towards Russia. In addition, the TV channel notes that the Russian Federation is beginning to act more actively in the field of diplomacy, while Western countries cannot fight back in this field. Georgian leak: The West called on Tbilisi to cut off contacts with Moscow. The special representative of the country's prime minister was caught in secret negotiations with his colleague from Russia. Earlier that day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the collective West, led by the United States, is putting pressure on countries that did not agree to support anti-Russian campaign. According to him, they are constantly blackmailed, threats are made to them, and they are promised to stop funding. In addition, on March 30, a member of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Dmitry Belik, in a conversation with Izvestia, said that the United States has been pursuing its own interests for years, interfering in the internal affairs of other states under the pretext of establishing democracy. On March 23, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said that the movement towards multipolarity in the world has accelerated, and Russia is at the forefront of this process. According to him, the Russian Federation today is fighting for the right to choose its own path, based on its national interests and acting for the benefit of its people. Prior to this, on March 20, Chinese President Xi Jinping noted that manifestations of hegemony, despotism and bullying cause serious damage to the whole world. The politician emphasized that today multipolarity, mutual cooperation, economic globalization and democratization of external relations have become a priority. On March 7, Professor of International Relations at Harvard University Stephen Walt pointed out that the United States does not want the return of a multipolar world, preferring to remain without strong rivals. Washington does not want to give up its status as an “indispensable power.” At the same time, many world leaders, including European ones, are striving for multipolarity. On February 10, American journalist Jackson Hinkle said that the world, thanks to Russian President Vladimir Putin, has become multipolar. At the end of October 2022, Putin called multipolarity the only way to restore the subjectivity of Europe. Western countries increased pressure on Moscow in connection with a special military operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin after the situation in the region worsened due to Ukrainian shelling .

"December 24 2023","Another rally of relatives of military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) took place on the central square of Kyiv. The publication Klymenko Time reported this on December 23. “On Independence Square there is another rally of relatives of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They demand that their relatives be demobilized,” says the publication’s Telegram channel. They are changing gender: what will the mobilization of women in Ukraine lead to? Future soldiers are caught in bars, sanatoriums and gyms. Earlier, on December 3, another rally was held in Kyiv near the city administration demanding the return home of conscripts and conscripts who have been at the front since the beginning of the conflict. Relatives of prisoners of war also demanded that the prisoner exchange be resumed. In addition, on the same day in Ukraine, a petition for the mobilization of Ukrainian deputies and officials received the necessary 25 thousand votes, which should then be considered by the country's President Vladimir Zelensky. Martial law has been in force in Ukraine since February 2022, at the same time Zelensky signed the law on general mobilization of citizens, according to which men aged 18 to 60 years are prohibited from leaving the country. This summer, the country's authorities expanded the list of citizens subject to mobilization.

"February 22 2024","It is becoming increasingly clear that the West may lose in the conflict in Ukraine. Politico wrote about this on February 21. “It may be too early to say that the West will lose <in the conflict> in Ukraine, but it is becoming increasingly clear that this is possible,” the article says. Politico, citing one of the participants The Munich Security Conference over the weekend also reported that the mood of Western leaders attending the event was ""somber"" amid Russia's victories on the battlefield. It noted that Western reticence in supplying more powerful weapons and stricter sanctions against the Russian Federation “suggests that behind the bold speeches about helping Ukraine “as much as it takes,” it is quite possible that there is another, unspoken agenda dictating the actions of the West.” Thus, a possible outcome in Ukraine, according to European diplomats, could be “pushing Kyiv to negotiate with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin on freezing the conflict” and consolidating current territorial realities in exchange for Western “security guarantees” and a path to European Union (EU) membership. In addition, they say, the prospect of increased Western financial and military assistance in 2024 is met with great skepticism in European embassies. Another unspoken Western intention is that “some groups hope to return to business as usual with Russia” soon after a hypothetical freeze in the conflict . Proof of this can be seen in the fact that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz opposed the appointment of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as the next NATO Secretary General because she was “too critical of Moscow.” “The West has not given up on Ukraine. But his predominant focus on risk management indicates a desire to nullify the conflict and make a deal with Putin, and the sooner the better,” the authors of the material summarized. To spite Trump: NATO may begin to coordinate assistance to Ukraine instead of the United States Western countries are thinking about revising the mechanism for distributing military supplies to Kyiv On February 21, former intelligence officer of the US Armed Forces Tony Shaffer said that the Russian military had prevailed not only over the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), but also over The North Atlantic Alliance, which continues to actively support Kyiv. The ex-intelligence officer stressed that no financial investments will help the Ukrainian army change the situation on the battlefield and stop the advance of Russian troops. Earlier, on February 20, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, during a meeting with the Russian President, indicated that NATO military science was a complete fiasco in conflict in Ukraine, and Western instructors and their methods did not help the country achieve success. The minister noted that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are completely controlled by Western states, and the Ukrainian counter-offensive was planned in detail under the leadership of the United States and NATO instructors, he said. Prior to this, on February 19, the chairman of the Federation Council commission on information policy and interaction with the media, Alexei Pushkov, said that NATO had recognized a major a miscalculation on the issue of the conflict in Ukraine, but this does not lead to a change in the alliance’s course. According to him, the systemic mistake of the United States and the West in general is to overestimate their own capabilities. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by the Russian President on February 24 last year, continues.

"18 March 2023","NATO's shortage of ammunition and the difficulty of producing weapons for Ukraine could lead to a split in the North Atlantic Alliance. Columnist Lily Bayer wrote about this in an article for Politico published on Saturday, March 18. She noted that member countries of the alliance are concerned about their own stockpiles of ammunition, while Kyiv points to the need for additional weapons from allies. “There is a risk that “not all NATO allies will fulfill promises to contribute to the alliance’s new plans,” she writes. To solve this problem, the military bloc must convince individual states to increase defense spending and provide various resources. As Bayer emphasizes, restocking will take a lot of time and, in principle, will be possible only if countries find companies capable of quickly producing high-quality shells. “All this is very difficult. Obviously, this requires time, as well as financial investments,” said former commander of US ground forces in Europe Ben Hodges, whose words are quoted by the author of the material. Earlier, on March 15, the Politico newspaper wrote that the United States insists that the Armed Forces Ukraine (AFU) conserved artillery shells and conducted targeted fire. Former commander of NATO forces in Europe Ben Hodges also admitted that the consumption of shells is too fast. However, he pointed out that Russian artillery has an advantage and has sufficient ammunition. Munich talk: what the West promised Kyiv at a conference in Germany And how does Washington know about China’s plans for Ukraine On March 14, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called for the acceleration and strengthening of military assistance to Kyiv from Western countries. He noted the international reaction to the conflict in Ukraine and considered it a guarantee of “containing any country from launching an unprovoked attack.” Prior to this, on February 28, the head of the German Ministry of Defense Boris Pistorius said that the state of the German Armed Forces at the present time would not allow them to contain the defense in the event attack by a potential enemy. According to the minister, the Bundeswehr is unable to protect either its NATO allies or even its own citizens. On February 14, the Politico newspaper wrote that Ukrainian militants will have to use fewer weapons on the battlefield due to the depletion of the arsenal in Western countries. The publication also cited the words of US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who said that Western countries are focusing on training the Ukrainian Armed Forces to maneuver so that they rely less on artillery. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which Russian authorities have reported announced on February 24, 2022 amid the worsening situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"December 2023","American society is tired of constant assistance to Kyiv; people do not believe in Ukraine’s victory and are writing off its president, Vladimir Zelensky. The leader of the French Patriots party, Florian Philippot, spoke about this on December 7. “Refusal of financial assistance to Kyiv is a disaster for Zelensky. American society is tired of sending money and weapons to Ukraine amid its defeat. The priority for the United States is now its own problems. In addition, the 2024 presidential elections are approaching, this political context also has an impact on the Ukrainian issue,” he noted in a conversation with TASS. The politician also emphasized that the Americans are focused on their internal tasks and the Middle East conflict. Kyiv's problems have faded into the background for them; the Americans do not believe in his victory, he adds. Following the United States, members of the European Union will also stop supporting Ukraine, because such a position will be comfortable for them, Filippo believes. The politician is confident that Europe is ready to make loud promises to Ukraine, but this will not affect the essence. “The most ardent Europeanists will say that the European Union needs to come to replace the United States in the matter of sending money and weapons to Kyiv. However, things will not go beyond words: the European Union and its members have neither the military nor the financial means to ensure this continuity. Moreover, they have no such desire. We have already seen how Poland turned away from Ukraine. We have already seen the irritation Zelensky caused in Eastern European countries over agricultural exports. We saw that Germany talks a lot, but has not sent anything significant to Kyiv for many months,” Filippo said. Well, help: American aid to Ukraine will be revised. The form of support and its content will change, and the amounts will become smaller. Earlier, on December 6, the US Senate blocked the submission of a bill on aid to Ukraine to a vote. This bill also provided for assistance to Israel and Taiwan. On the same day, US President Joe Biden called on Congress to urgently approve the request for support from Kyiv. He noted that this is a top priority for Congress - ensuring the national security interests of the country and partners. However, Biden did not receive a response. Prior to this, on December 4, NBC News, citing representatives of Congress, reported that the US Democratic and Republican parties, trying to reach an agreement to consider a bill to protect the border and combat the migration crisis, failed negotiations regarding the request of the American President Joe Biden on additional support for Israel, Taiwan and Ukraine. In turn, Jake Sullivan said at a briefing that day that the American Congress should provide additional funds to the US administration as soon as possible so that assistance to Ukraine does not stop. Western countries have strengthened their military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"28 August 2023","Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, during an interview with journalist Natalya Moseychuk, said that holding elections during martial law in the country is prohibited, but the process can be organized if parliament supports changes to legislation, the West provides financial support, and international observers go “into the trenches.” Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on CIS Affairs, Eurasian Integration and Relations with Compatriots Artem Turov said on August 28 that the Ukrainian authorities do not want to carry out the necessary election procedures because they understand that the attitude of voters is undergoing a change. “There is nothing surprising in the statement of the Ukrainian authorities, because that over the past few years, in fact, those people who are in power have usurped it, and do not want to carry out the necessary election procedures, because they understand that the attitude of voters living in Ukraine is undergoing quite a serious change,” leads words of the Duma TV deputy for Izvestia. At the same time, Turov drew attention to the fact that rhetoric familiar to official Kyiv was being observed. The Ukrainian side has been blackmailing Western countries for a long time regarding both weapons and supplies, emphasizing that it will do anything only with financial support, the deputy explained. “This is understandable, because in fact, without these financial injections, without equipment, Without weapons, Ukraine would have long ago ceased to exist as a de facto state. It rests only on those financial sources sent by the countries of the united West,” Turov concluded. Without announcing a wave: how a new stage of mobilization is taking place in Ukraine From raids on the streets, military commissars moved on to storming houses and apartments. On July 30, ex-adviser to former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, political scientist Oleg Soskin expressed the opinion that Ukraine will face a civil war if Kyiv decides to extend martial law once and not hold presidential elections in 2024. Later, on August 17, Verkhovna Rada deputy Yaroslav Zheleznyak said that Zelensky signed the laws adopted by parliament on extending martial law and on general mobilization in the country for another 90 days.

"20 June 2023","In Lvov, old graves are being dug up to bury military personnel killed during the current hostilities in Ukraine. This was revealed in a report from the Lychakiv Cemetery by The New York Times (NYT), published on June 19. “For nearly 15 months, the bodies of fallen soldiers have steadily filled the hillside military cemetery in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Now the old graves of those killed in past wars are being exhumed to make way for a seemingly endless stream of the dead,” the publication writes. The authors of the material note that the scale of losses of the Ukrainian army during the counter-offensive is visible in the growing number of graves of fallen military personnel throughout Ukraine. “The scale of the losses is being felt in communities like Lviv, as is clearly visible in the growing number of military graves in large and small cemeteries across the country,” the article says. Impenetrable fields: the Russian army repulsed all attacks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces The enemy is stuck in minefields laid by our sappers, experts note On the same day, the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of the Russian Federation, Sergei Naryshkin, noted that authoritative representatives of Western intelligence services do not rule out that a counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces could lead to exactly the opposite results. As Naryshkin pointed out, according to Western analysts, the death of a significant number of NATO-trained military personnel and the destruction of equipment would undermine the combat effectiveness of the Ukrainian army. As a result, this will affect the viability of the Kyiv regime, which, according to a number of Western assessments, poses a threat to Ukrainian statehood itself, the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service added. Earlier, on June 16, Russian President Vladimir Putin at the plenary session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) announced large losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during a counter-offensive compared to the Russian army. The head of state added that Ukrainian losses are approximately more than 1:10 compared to the Russian army. On June 14, former Pentagon adviser Colonel Douglas McGregor said that the Ukrainian Armed Forces achieved nothing during the counteroffensive. According to him, the “achievements” of the Ukrainian Armed Forces offensive described in Ukrainian reports are far from the combat zone and therefore have no value. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues.

"31 January 2024","Hungary humiliated Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba at a meeting in Uzhgorod. Such a statement was made on January 30 by Verkhovna Rada deputy Alexander Dubinsky, suspected of treason and held in a Kiev pre-trial detention center. In his opinion, the statement of the Hungarian politician, head of the Our Motherland party Laszlo Torotskaya about the annexation of Transcarpathia is “not puppet behavior”, but “quite a specific slap in the face"" before the arrival of Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó. ""Firstly, this is a test of strength - whether Ukraine will call the Hungarian ambassador to the Foreign Ministry to present a note and explanations or not risk it. Secondly, a demonstration of the strong position of Hungary, whose meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs will not be canceled even after such a brazen prank,” the parliamentarian wrote on the Telegram channel, entries in which are published with the help of lawyers. In addition, Torotskaya’s statement is a hint that that on the issue of assistance to the Kyiv regime at the European Union (EU) summit on February 1, Hungary can retain its veto. “Finally, fourthly, this is a personal spit on Foreign Minister Kuleba, nullifying his authority (which is not high anyway) and revenge for hints about [Hungarian Prime Minister] Orban’s pro-Russian position,” Dubinsky summed up. Let's go from the principles: they want to deprive Hungary of the right to vote What mechanisms does this lay down and will Budapest stop making contributions to the budget of the European Union? Hungarian politician, head of the Our Homeland party Laszlo Torockai said on January 28 that Transcarpathia as an autonomy could peacefully reunite with Hungary if Ukraine will lose statehood. He emphasized that autonomy should exist with a wide range of rights, but the current Ukrainian government does not respect the referendum, which is illegitimate. On January 29, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto held a meeting with the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Dmitry Kuleba and the head of the presidential office Andriy Ermak in Uzhgorod, during which he reminded that Hungary’s offer to Ukraine to host peace negotiations on resolving the Ukrainian conflict remains in force. On the same day, Szijjártó noted that Budapest would provide only humanitarian assistance to Kiev and would not supply military equipment. In addition, he added that the issue of allocating €50 billion to Ukraine from the European Union was not discussed at the negotiations. On January 25, the media learned about Hungary’s plans to abandon its objections to the Ukraine assistance fund. At the same time, Bloomberg associates the refusal of Hungary’s objections with the fact that pressure is growing on the country’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban over the issue of admitting Sweden to NATO. Hungary, at a meeting in Brussels on Ukraine, which took place on December 14–15, blocked the allocation to Kyiv €50 billion. In the same month, Orban proposed that the EU refrain from helping Ukraine over the next five years, noting that the €50 billion that the union is going to transfer to Kyiv simply does not exist. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of a Russian special operation for the protection of Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 by Russian President Vladimir Putin after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

No one was injured, but the glazing in nearby buildings was damaged, she added. Another local resident noted that during I was at home at the time of the explosion, but I was worried about the child, whom my wife had taken to kindergarten. “I immediately called and found out where my wife was and where the child was. [After that] he ran out into the street,” the man said. “Finally, we have realized our right to live the way we want” Lugansk celebrated the entry of the republic into Russia. Earlier that day, the ex-head of the representative office of the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) in Russia, Rodion Miroshnik, reported two explosions in Lugansk. He suggested that the target of the strikes could be the territory of the former Aviation School of Navigators. On May 13, Lugansk announced that the Ukrainian Armed Forces began striking the city with Anglo-French-made Storm Shadow cruise missiles, the transfer of which to Kyiv was announced by the British Ministry of Defense on May 11. According to him military observer Viktor Litovkin, the Ukrainian side is trying to sow fear by striking Lugansk. The expert believes that Kyiv’s attacks are revenge on Donbass for choosing Russia.

"21 November 2023","In the village of Borodyanka, Kyiv region, representatives of the schismatic Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) in military uniform seized the temple in honor of the Archangel Michael of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). The First Cossack TV channel reported this on Tuesday, November 21, in its Telegram channel. “On the night of November 20, a group of raiders from the OCU, with the help of unknown persons in military uniform and the police, brutally took away the temple from Orthodox Christians. Eyewitnesses of the events say that activists for the OCU literally threw UOC parishioners out of the shrine, and the police kept people while the crime was being committed,” the report says. According to the website of the Moscow Patriarchate, the Church of the Archangel Michael was transferred to the OCU by illegal vote on July 9, 2023. As a result, the rector, Archpriest Victor Talko, was removed from the church, and a priest from the OCU was appointed in his place. Crisis of faith: why Ukraine started banning the UOC The Verkhovna Rada supported the bill in the first reading. Oppression of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church occurs systematically. Thus, the day before, the Union of Orthodox Journalists reported that in Cherkassy, raiders in camouflage from the OCU stormed the monastery of the canonical UOC Nativity of the Virgin Mary. It was noted that the invaders threw the monastery property into the street, broke windows and knocked out the entrance doors. Prior to this, on November 9, in the Chernivtsi region of Ukraine, security forces surrounded the Holy Ascension Banchensky Monastery. They searched the monastery. It was noted that people who live on the territory of the temple are scared. In 2022, the Ukrainian authorities intensified actions directed against the UOC. They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” Thus, in December of the same year, the Security Service of Ukraine opened 50 criminal cases against priests of the UOC.

"25 February 2023","The US and NATO countries are manipulating Germany as a puppet, forcing Berlin to supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. The successes of Western countries in this matter force us to doubt the existence of any independence of the German position, as stated by political scientist Richard Werner in a conversation with Izvestia on Friday, February 24. Cancel reservation: what the Russian Armed Forces can oppose to Western tanks Modern ATGMs are capable of hitting any type of European and American-made vehicles He emphasized that German assistance to the Kyiv regime and the constantly increasing transfers of weapons lead to confrontation between Russia and the United States. “It looks as if Germany The United States, as well as other NATO members, manipulate quite effectively. Everyone seemed to be pushing Germany: “Yes, yes, you supply Leopard 2 tanks, we will also supply all the tanks that we have. Yes Yes Yes"". But then it turned out that only Germany supplied its heavy tanks. But this only shows the weak, if not non-existent position of Germany,” Werner emphasized. According to him, Germany is still not sovereign, the country’s government is under US occupation, if you look at the details from the legal side. “The German government is just an occupation administration, which may have changed in 1990. And I think that the intention was clearly on the Soviet side. The intention was to make Germany a sovereign state, and the Soviet Union and Russia withdrew their troops, but the United States and Great Britain did not,” said the political scientist. The day before, in the German city of Dresden, more than a thousand people took part in a demonstration against arms supplies to Ukraine. The demonstration was organized by the right-wing movement Pegida and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. On February 17, Bundestag member Gregor Gysi said that Germany should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine and begin peace negotiations. Gysi is convinced that an immediate ceasefire is necessary. According to him, for this it is necessary to apply pressure and apply diplomacy. Meanwhile, on February 8, during a meeting with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and French leader Emmanuel Macron in Paris, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that Berlin would transfer military assistance to Kyiv as much as necessary. In response to this, Zelensky called on the heads of European countries to transfer tanks and heavy weapons to Ukraine “as soon as possible.” On February 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin called it incredible that Russia was again threatened by German tanks. The head of state drew a parallel with the times of the Great Patriotic War. According to him, the enemies are again going to fight with Russia on the soil of Ukraine “with the hands of Hitler’s last descendants, with the hands of Bandera’s followers.” On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to hold it was made by Putin against the backdrop of an aggravated situation in the region due to increased shelling of Ukrainian troops.

After the incident, Milley, then head of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, called Zaluzhny to apologize. However, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that the leak of documents could be useful, since it does not say anything about the F-16, which means they need to be transferred as soon as possible. “Milly laughed,” WP reports the words of the Ukrainian official. The newspaper also reported that US leaders were “furious” when the data leak occurred. Database: how reliable is the leak of information from the Pentagon?

He noted that the country's President Emmanuel Macron announced new deliveries of about 40 SCALP surface-to-air missiles to Kyiv. A day earlier, Lecornu said that Ukraine had acquired six more Caesar self-propelled artillery systems from France.

"June 2023","The peoples of Russia and Ukraine are not interested in the conflict; a military clash between Moscow and Kyiv is of interest only to the USA and England. This was stated by Secretary of the Security Council (SC) of the Russian Federation Nikolai Patrushev to journalists following a meeting of the Security Council secretaries of the CSTO countries on June 8. According to Patrushev, the UK and the USA are not concerned about the people who died during the conflict in Ukraine, since they are not citizens of these countries. In this connection, he added that Ukraine was ready to make peace with Russia during negotiations in the spring of 2022, but under pressure from the United States, Kyiv stopped contacting Russia. “Even the leaders of Ukraine were ready to conclude a peace treaty and gave Russia proposals in writing, which we approved in principle,” Patrushev noted. In addition, the Security Council Secretary added that Washington’s ultimate goal is to weaken China, as the United States seeks to prevent the emergence of a multipolar world. “A very serious pole of a multipolar world is China. Therefore, Russia is not the final goal, they want to destroy or weaken Russia, but their ultimate goal in general is China,” Patrushev said. No runway: The United States will continue consultations on the supply of F-16s to Kyiv Russia called the West's plans to send fighters to Ukraine a move towards escalation Earlier, on June 7, Newsweek reported that the United States and the countries of the European Union (EU) may begin to consider peace initiatives to resolve the Ukrainian conflict after an unsuccessful offensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU).

The situation will become more complicated especially against the backdrop of election campaigns in the West.

"November 29 2023","The conflict between the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Valery Zaluzhny was provoked by the failure of the counteroffensive. This was reported by The Economist magazine on Tuesday, November 28. “Relations between President Vladimir Zelensky and his commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny are assessed as terrible,” the article says. Relations between the president and commander-in-chief deteriorated after Zaluzhny’s interview with The Economist in early November, in which the general called the Ukrainian conflict a dead end for Kiev. The magazine, citing a source in the Ukrainian government, suggests that “open conflict in the leadership was the predictable result of a stalled counter-offensive operation that did not go according to plan.” Zaluzhny dared to speak out against the optimistic views of his president, which marked the beginning of discord. Meanwhile, in the Kyiv administration, according to the magazine, many express agreement with the more sober and objective assessment of the commander in chief. The same sentiments, judging by polls, persist among the country's population. “Figures dated mid-November show that trust in the president has fallen to +32%, which is half that of the still revered General Zaluzhny (+70%). “, the publication reported. The article expresses the opinion that Zelensky will lose in the upcoming presidential elections if Zaluzhny decides to run. At the same time, as The Economist writes, the soldiers of the Ukrainian army at the front are simply trying to survive while a split occurs within the Kyiv administration. “People under fire don’t care whether Zaluzhny quarreled with Zelensky or not,” the magazine quotes the words of one of the commanders of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. While the top government is trying to figure out who is right and who is wrong, the main question for people at the front is how to stay alive, the publication summarizes. Coup or resignation: what will the conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny lead to? Experts told the details of political intrigues. On November 27, it was reported that in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there is growing dissatisfaction with the generals, the government and Zelensky personally. Thus, soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces pointed out the “imprudence” of the country’s leadership, and also stated the absence of a communication system between neighboring units in the army. They noted that each department has to fight for itself. Before this, on November 14, Verkhovna Rada deputy Yevgeny Shevchenko accused Zaluzhny of failing the counteroffensive. He said that President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, precisely at Zaluzhny’s request, is asking Western partners for new types of equipment, but they do not bring results on the battlefield. Prior to this, on November 11, The Telegraph newspaper wrote that the failures of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at the front broke Zelensky. As the publication noted then, the President of Ukraine for the first time publicly criticized the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, who announced a stalemate for the Ukrainian troops at the front. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

"30 April 2023","The counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) is unlikely to end in success. Columnist Michael Schwirtz wrote about this on April 29 in an article for The New York Times. He noted that the combat missions assigned to Ukrainian militants are “frightening.” Because for a successful counteroffensive, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will need to overcome not only “Russian lines that have been well fortified for ten months,” but also the shortcomings of its own army. As Schwirtz noted, American officials say that significant changes on the battlefield as a result of the Ukrainian counteroffensive are unlikely. In addition, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are reducing their stock of weapons, the journalist recalled. “After 14 months of incessant fighting, Ukrainian soldiers are exhausted,” Shvirts emphasized. Increase supplies: will Kyiv receive weapons for a counteroffensive? The 11th meeting of the contact group on Ukraine was held in Germany at the American Ramstein base. Earlier that day, Zelensky confirmed plans for a counteroffensive by Kyiv and expressed confidence that the Ukrainian Armed Forces would be able to seize Crimea. He added that the success of the Ukrainian army will largely depend on the supply of Western weapons. After this, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev called for the complete defeat of the Kyiv regime, as well as the destruction of the personnel and equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces during the counter-offensive. Also on April 29, The Times wrote that The Ukrainian Armed Forces will hardly be able to achieve success in their counter-offensive. At the same time, the material indicates that Kyiv has no choice but to attack in the spring or summer. Currently, Ukrainian militants are mastering 1,550 armored vehicles and 230 tanks, which were provided to them by the West. Chairman of the “We are together with Russia” movement Vladimir Rogov said that the timing of the counter-offensive of Ukrainian militants is being shifted, presumably until May, when dry weather sets in. On April 28, ex-adviser Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin said that Zelensky is not coping with his responsibilities and the promised counter-offensive is not ready. He advised the Ukrainians to leave the combat zone as soon as possible. The day before, retired US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter noted that at the moment the Ukrainian army had lost 80% of its strength since the start of the special operation to protect Donbass. He clarified that Ukraine had a regular army of 260 thousand people at the very beginning. Soskin on April 26 said that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are not able to attack due to a lack of weapons, personnel and missiles that can fire at a distance of 150 km. Head of the Defense Forces Kharkov Brigadier General Sergei Melnik said on April 24 that the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not have enough people and military equipment. He called on international allies to provide more weapons. The Washington Post on April 16 indicated that US officials acknowledge the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have enough ammunition for a successful counter-offensive. It is impossible without additional supplies of artillery and tanks from Western countries, the material noted. Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said on April 13 that the American media are publishing more and more information about Kyiv’s supposedly preparing counter-offensive. He expressed confidence in the failure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine if the attempted counter-offensive is carried out. Prior to this, on April 10, the head of the defense committee of the Federation Council, Viktor Bondarev, said that the counter-offensive, which Kiev is intensively preparing, is doomed to failure. He recalled that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are severely depleted.

"December 29 2023","The Kiev administration accepted the new aid package from the United States with “cool gratitude.” This was reported by The Washington Post on Thursday, December 28. “A modest new US arms package for Ukraine - which will likely be the last until Congress approves new funding - was greeted with lukewarm gratitude in Kyiv on Thursday,” it said in the material. Washington provided Ukraine with an assistance package of $250 million, which included air defense equipment, anti-tank missiles, artillery shells and other weapons, but Kyiv will not have enough of this amount. This package, according to the authors of the article, can solve some problems on the battlefield, but still leaves Ukraine facing an uncertain future and without significant financial support in the new year. According to Ukrainian parliament member Yegor Chernev, if the US Congress does not approve the allocation of new support in the near future, then in January the Ukrainians will be threaten deprivation of social benefits and reduction of wages. With fear and doubts: the West is not sure about the future of Ukraine The French President hinted at the fatigue of the United States and the EU from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Earlier that day, Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence Yegor Chernev said that Ukraine will lose territory , if it does not receive military assistance from the United States. He said some soldiers and commanders in the Ukrainian army said the shortage had forced them to curtail some operations and shift to a defensive strategy. On December 27, Washington decided to provide Ukraine with a new aid package worth up to $250 million, as announced by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The final package in 2023 will include weapons and equipment, he added. On December 21, Blinken said that Washington’s continued support is crucial for Kyiv. He also said that the United States has a clear plan for the development of Ukraine without the financial support that the country has to provide now. On December 19, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller announced the impossibility of providing assistance to Ukraine bypassing the US Congress. He added that Washington does not have a “magic pot” from which it could draw assistance to Kyiv without a congressional decision on additional funding. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022 .

This was stated on May 12 by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose speech was broadcast by M1 TV channel. “If the Brussels bureaucrats can overcome their well-developed Hungarian phobia, then Hungary and Brussels together will be capable of great things,” said the head of government. Speaking about the organization’s relations with Hungary, Orban expressed regret that the Hungarian city of Vesperm, chosen as the European Capital of Culture in 2023, is rather one of the few positive exceptions. However, the Prime Minister recalled that the main goals of the European Union are the peace and prosperity of its members associations. However, currently in European countries the economic situation leaves much to be desired. Harmful independence: why Americans are punishing Hungary Viktor Orban is confident that Ukraine is costing the EU countries too much Earlier, on May 7, Slovak parliamentarian Peter Marcek, in a conversation with Izvestia, said that Orban defends the interests of the country and pursues a policy independent of the European Union, despite the fact that Brussels continues to put pressure on the country. On May 5, Orban said that Hungary is not interested in the degradation of the Ukrainian conflict, because the current situation directly affects the fate of Hungarians living in Ukraine. In this regard, the Republic is doubly motivated to resolve the geopolitical crisis as quickly as possible. On April 28, Bloomberg reported that Hungary has seen a significant decrease in support for the European Union. Only 39% of Hungarians support the bloc's policies, which has become a historical low for the country. Many aspects of EU policy displease the Hungarian government. Thus, on April 24, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic, Peter Szijjártó, at the Council of Foreign Ministers of the EU countries again stated that the country opposes the supply of weapons to Ukraine.

"October 2023","With a possible reduction in aid, Ukraine will find itself in a difficult situation, which could lead to Kyiv asking for peace on unfavorable terms. Historian Hal Brands wrote about this on October 5 in his material for Bloomberg. “At best, a US retreat will put Ukraine in a brutal impasse. In the worst case, this will cause a gradual surrender of positions, which will force Kyiv to seek peace on unfavorable terms,” the agency’s observer wrote. Brands indicated that in this situation, other Western countries may try to make up for the shortfall in US aid. However, according to the historian, if Western states allocate more funds to Ukraine, their arsenals will still not be enough to supply Kyiv with what is necessary until 2025. He emphasized that the shortage of weapons will directly affect the balance of forces on the line of combat contact. They break the comedian: Washington is changing its strategy towards Zelensky The White House will be forced to explain to the electorate the failure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ counter-offensive On the eve of October 4, former CIA Russia analyst George Beebe reported that Europe and the United States are showing signs of fatigue from the conflict in Ukraine. In his opinion, worries about assistance from Western countries undermine the morale of the Ukrainian forces and affect the situation at the front. Prior to this, on September 30, American leader Joe Biden signed a law extending government funding for 45 days, which did not include assistance to Ukraine. This is how a government shutdown was prevented in the United States. American political scientist Malek Dudakov said that assistance to Kyiv from Washington, which was not included in the law on temporary financing of the American government, will continue, but in a smaller volume. At the same time, in his opinion, the Republicans will try to prevent this, since there is also a split within the party. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 by Russian leader Vladimir Putin after aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on March 2 that the German authorities are engaged in investigation into the leak of a recording of a conversation between German officers, and called this situation a very serious problem. Bild reported then that Graefe was to blame for the incident because he connected to the conversation from Singapore through an unsecured network, creating a threat to the security of the conversation. The Ukrainian side is attempting to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 of the year. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, since, according to him, this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"26 February 2023","Militants blew up a dam in Artemovsk (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut) to slow down the advance of the Russian military. This was stated by Advisor to the Acting Head of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) Igor Kimakovsky on Saturday, February 25. The roundabout route: how the Russian army forms a ring around Artemovsk From the dominant heights of the liberated Paraskovievka, the supply routes for the VFU group are well covered “As a result of the explosion of the dam, water flows went to Artemovsk. Firstly, in this way they [the militants] are trying to stop our offensive. Perhaps they decided to cut off our assault units from the rear structures in order to slow down the supply of ammunition. Secondly, they announced the evacuation of the civilian population and want residents to leave the city,” he said in an interview with RIA Novosti. According to Kimakovsky, the militants’ goal is to create unacceptable living conditions and destroy the city so that its restoration can be unaffordable from an economic point of view. He added that the explosion of the dam may indicate an intention to leave Artemovsk, and the actions of the Kyiv regime can be described as “desperate.” The explosion of the dam in Artemovsk became known earlier in the day, on February 25. Advisor to the acting head of the DPR, Yan Gagin, said that the explosion led to the flooding of houses and basements in which people were hiding. At the same time, The Times wrote that Ukrainian and Western officials are ready to recognize the need for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) to leave the city. The publication’s interlocutors admitted that otherwise the Ukrainian nationalists could be surrounded and cut off from supply routes. On February 23, Gagin said that in the Artemovsk and Ugledarsk directions, the Armed Forces of Ukraine were losing manpower and equipment, and were stealing the financial assistance of Western curators. Russia began conducting a special special operation on February 24, 2022 operations to protect Donbass. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region as a result of shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"October 2023","The US Armed Forces may abandon the M1 Abrams tanks due to the poor survivability of the equipment, which manifested itself in the conflict in Ukraine. This was reported by the online publication Asia Times on Monday, October 9. “A US Army study recommended phasing out the M1 Abrams tank in favor of lighter, smaller unmanned vehicles, citing survivability problems experienced on the battlefield <…> in Ukraine,” the publication writes. The study reportedly highlights the need for a next-generation M1 variant equipped with larger caliber guns, as well as hypersonic anti-tank missiles. The US Army Science Board also predicts that tanks and armored vehicles will face new threats in the future from modern anti-tank weapons, drones and artificial intelligence capabilities. Forces from heaven: the Airborne Forces will be reinforced with tanks and helicopters How will this affect the combat capabilities of the “winged infantry” To date, the United States has supplied 31 Abrams tanks of outdated configuration to Ukraine. As American ex-marine Matthew Ho noted at the end of September, the United States is transferring outdated combat vehicles to Ukraine because modern Russian forces can easily intercept the supplied equipment, and the American leadership does not want new tanks to fall into the hands of the Russian Armed Forces. At the same time, a Russian soldier with the call sign Zhuk told Izvestia that Russian tanks have several advantages over Abrams. According to him, at a minimum, American armored vehicles are heavier, longer and higher compared to Russian ones, which allows them to inflict maximum damage. In the same month, ex-US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter noted that the delivery of Abrams to Kyiv gives Moscow the opportunity to show the whole world how American armored vehicles burn. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to hold it was announced on February 24, 2022 amid the worsening situation in the region.

"March 2023","US Army veteran Noctis Draven said a video posted on NATO Twitter criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin's statements about a special operation in Ukraine shows how scared Western countries are. Draven wrote about this on his Twitter account. We are talking about a video with a compilation of quotes from Putin, as well as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Kremlin representative Dmitry Peskov, which appeared on the NATO account on Friday, March 3. The creators of the video criticize Moscow's actions and ridicule statements by Russian authorities about the causes of the crisis in Ukraine. The roundabout route: how the Russian army forms a ring around Artemovsk From the commanding heights of the liberated Paraskovievka, the supply routes of the Ukrainian Federal Unitary Forces group are well covered. Analyzing the video, Draven drew attention to the fact that NATO representatives do not provide any evidence of their position and do not justify it in any way, all that they use , are just loud words. According to the veteran, this demonstrates their fear that people are trusting them less and less. “This is the reaction of a frightened empire, which is afraid that people have stopped believing its lies. They create propaganda to regain control, to maintain power,” Draven said. He added that the West is still trying to control the whole world. However, these attempts are doomed to failure. “It’s like trying to squeeze a fist full of sand, and in the end it will fall through your fingers,” the veteran concluded. Earlier, on March 3, Draven said that soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) should fold weapons or go over to the side of Russia, otherwise they face death for Western values and President Vladimir Zelensky. He noted that the Ukrainian military should start valuing their lives. Draven also noted that near Artemovsk (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut), Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers were left without artillery cover on the front line. According to the American military, the Kyiv authorities are using their fighters as an obstacle for Moscow, but do not set themselves the task of winning. On February 7, Draven, commenting on reports of the success of Russian forces near Artemovsk, said that Ukraine has no chance on the battlefield. According to the veteran, there is no doubt that “Russia will take Ukraine,” but this will not end there. The West will not just leave it like that. He expressed the opinion that Western countries will intensify propaganda to “lure the world and Americans into a war with Russia.” On February 1, former adviser to the head of the Pentagon, retired US Army Colonel Douglas McGregor, said that Ukraine is close to defeat, and serious demographic problems call into question the continued existence of the state. Earlier, on January 25, he said that Washington understands how close Ukraine is to defeat. McGregor added that from a legal point of view, American calls for Europe to supply arms to Kyiv can be regarded as “armed aggression.” On January 18, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia’s victory in the conflict in Ukraine is inevitable. According to him, this is possible thanks to the unity and cohesion of the Russian people, the courage and heroism of the fighters and the work of the military-industrial complex. On February 24, 2022, Russia began a special operation to protect Donbass. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region as a result of shelling by the Ukrainian military.

Chinese expert Song Zhongping said this on February 17 in an interview with the Global Times newspaper. “The signing of security pacts with France and Germany - two significant European states - has created a precedent that could potentially push other European countries to follow this example and strengthen cooperation with Ukraine.” “,” the publication quotes Zhongping as saying. In addition, according to the expert, Paris and Berlin will try to avoid direct armed conflicts with Moscow, and also not allow Kyiv to join the North Atlantic Alliance.

Also on February 16, Ukraine signed a similar agreement with Germany. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that in 2024 Germany will provide assistance to Ukraine in the amount of €15 billion. At the same time, the coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council (NSC) of the White House, John Kirby, said that the United States does not believe that Ukraine will be able to join NATO until the end of the armed conflict. In his opinion, Ukraine should focus on carrying out military reforms, and this will increase the chances of its joining the alliance. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on February 14 that the Russian Federation is concerned about the possibility of Ukraine being drawn into NATO, because this is a direct threat to the country’s state security. Ukraine on September 30 2022 submitted an application to join NATO on an accelerated basis. Then Zelensky said that in fact the country is already in the alliance and meets its standards.

"22 September 2023","Many Republicans in the US Congress will vote against continuing to provide assistance to Kyiv, so it is already “hanging by a thread.” This point of view was expressed by Washington Post foreign policy columnist Josh Rogin on September 22. In his opinion, this situation is due to the fact that Washington is increasingly focusing on the 2024 presidential campaign. And if US President Joe Biden's administration wants to continue to support Kyiv, it will need to make a stronger case about the expected costs and duration of military action. Otherwise, aid to Ukraine becomes “increasingly vulnerable to partisan divisions and culture wars.” “When the next tranche comes up for a vote in Congress, the number of Republicans voting against it will be high,” the author points out in the article.

According to available information, he suspects that the US President's interest in helping Ukraine has begun to fade. And the leaders of other states are likely following the example of the United States, the media notes. On September 21, Biden, following negotiations with Zelensky at the White House, said that a new package of military assistance to Ukraine from the United States has already been approved. And the Abrams tanks will be transferred to Kyiv next week. At the same time, Axios reported that the President of Ukraine, who is in Washington on an official visit, received a “cold reception” in the US Congress.

We have partners, and we will receive help from them, but it will be much less, or [the conflict] will reach Lvov,” the newspaper quotes the words of the interlocutor with the call sign Spencer. In the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they emphasized the dependence on the support of Western countries, since the volume of arms production in Ukraine does not cover the needs of its army.

British Foreign Minister David Cameron said this on December 7 at the Aspen Security forum, addressing Congress, Bloomberg reports. “If you vote for this package, no matter how you do it and no matter what you link it to in Congress, it will give a huge a boost to these European countries,"" he said during his speech. Cameron stressed that this vote will have a huge impact on Congress because it will allow countries that want to support Ukraine to set an example for other countries next year. ""European security is so does American security, and we must remain united on this issue, we must transfer this money to the Ukrainians, we must support them <...>,” Cameron said. Congressional dissonance: who in the United States is stopping support for Kyiv And what exactly Republicans and Democrats cannot share Earlier, on December 6, the US Senate at its next meeting did not approve the bill to provide the next aid package to Ukraine. American political scientist Malek Dudakov noted the next day, December 7, that the US Republican Party is using the issue of additional assistance to Ukraine as a lever of pressure on the Democrats. He suggested that the discussion process could drag on until mid-January. The Americanist believes that assistance to Kyiv will be in a smaller volume than requested by the administration of US President Joe Biden, therefore, Republicans and Democrats will take a long time to reach a compromise. Moreover, also on that day, December 6, due to the uncertainty on this issue, Biden spoke with a special appeal, saying that Congress must urgently approve a request for funds for Ukraine. At the same time, Pentagon head Lloyd Austin indicated that Washington is committed to long-term military support for Kyiv even in the face of a delay in the allocation of new assistance. Austin stressed that he expects Congress to quickly approve the administration's request for additional assistance to Kyiv for $50 billion through the US industrial base. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which began on February 24, 2022 due to the escalation situation in the region as a result of Ukrainian shelling. At the same time, recently there have been increasingly frequent statements in the West about the need to reduce support for Ukraine.

"11 March 2023","The Russian command changed its tactics of bypassing air defense systems when launching missile attacks on targets in Ukraine, which brought results. This opinion was expressed on Saturday, March 11, by American military expert Douglas Barry. “Moscow appears to have adapted its missile attacks <...> using a combination of subsonic cruise missiles and much higher-speed Kinzhal aeroballistic missiles, as well as possibly decoys and other countermeasures,” Barry said on CNN. The expert also drew attention to the fact that the Russian Federation began to use more missiles when attacking Ukrainian targets. “Over the past six months or so, there has been a trend towards increasing the intervals between missile attacks, but when they do land, more missiles are deployed at once to make it harder for defenses to intercept them all,” Barry said. He added that Russia’s change of tactics is an effective but necessary measure, the reason for which is the continuation of Western pumping of Ukraine weapons. Get the Daggers: a missile strike was launched in response to the Bryansk terrorist attack. Hypersonic weapons were used to destroy particularly important objects. On March 9, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that the Russian Armed Forces launched a massive retaliatory strike on the military infrastructure of Ukraine in response to a terrorist attack committed by Ukrainian saboteurs in the Bryansk region. As a result, the base sites of Ukrainian attack drones were destroyed, the transfer of reserves and railway transportation of foreign weapons was disrupted, and production facilities for the repair of military equipment and the production of ammunition were disabled. The Russian Ministry of Defense added that the Russian Armed Forces used long-range precision weapons, including including the Kinzhal hypersonic missile systems. On the same day, military expert Alexey Leonkov said that during these strikes the Kinzhals were used to hit particularly important targets. Thus, he noted that “Daggers,” in his opinion, could be used against objects that supported the Ukrainian combat group on the contact line. In particular, the attack could have been carried out on military equipment, which is now actively coming from NATO countries and accumulating in rear areas. On March 2, a group of Ukrainian saboteurs fired at a car in which there were children and took several people hostage in the village of Lyubechan, Bryansk region. As a result of the attack, two people were killed and schoolboy Fedor was wounded. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the incident a terrorist attack. He pointed out that the terrorists saw that they were shooting at a civilian car - an ordinary Niva, where civilians and children were sitting. Russian troops began striking critical targets in Ukraine on October 10, 2022. As Putin explained, this was a response to the terrorist actions of the Kyiv regime, in particular, on the Crimean Bridge.

"28 February 2024","US President Joe Biden should receive additional powers from the US Congress to seize frozen Russian assets and further send them to help Ukraine. White House Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby made this statement at a press conference on February 27. “I want to make a couple of things clear. First, we still need legislative authority from Congress that will allow the president to act in this direction,” he said. The second, equally important point, according to Kirby, is the need for coalition partners who also have frozen assets. “so that they act together” with the United States. He noted that negotiations with partners are ongoing. The frozen assets are planned to be sent to Ukraine to strengthen its defense, as well as to rebuild the country after the end of hostilities, Kirby added. Separable funds: the Russian Federation proposed a response to plans to confiscate assets in Europe What measures are being prepared by the Federation Council and the Ministry of Finance and how the EU may react to them Earlier, on February 27, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that Washington’s intention to transfer frozen Russian assets to Kyiv is extremely erroneous, it will only hurt Western countries. As he clarified, Western countries would harm themselves with such a decision in the same way when they introduced restrictions on payments in dollars, logistics and clearing systems. On the same day, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced that the G7 countries ( G7) have not currently developed a strategy for the confiscation of frozen assets of the Russian Federation and are concerned that these actions comply with national and international law. The head of the US Treasury also expressed the opinion that one of the options for using Russian assets frozen by the West could be their collateral for borrowing on world markets. On February 26, Siluanov said that any actions with Russian assets abroad will receive a symmetrical response, since no less than . According to him, other countries are already drawing their own conclusions in connection with what is happening, in particular, “the Chinese are reducing their participation in American securities.” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre admitted on February 23 that the United States and allies are facing difficulties in confiscating frozen assets of the Russian Federation for the purpose of their further transfer to Ukraine. Washington will conduct negotiations on these activities with its G7 allies at the international level and in the US Congress at the domestic level. However, Director of the Communications Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Julie Kozak warned that the confiscation of Russia's sovereign assets could harm the international monetary system and Western countries must find “sufficient legal grounds” to carry out such an operation. At the same time, on February 10, the Russian Foreign Ministry promised a tough response to the confiscation of Russian frozen assets and their transfer to Ukraine. On February 22, Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Nikolai Zhuravlev said that Russia has the right to apply mirror measures if Western countries try to seize its frozen assets, because this is illegal confiscation of state property. Zhuravlev proposed to seize the income of Western countries through taxes. He called on the Ministry of Finance to develop such a mechanism. On February 10, the Russian Foreign Ministry promised a tough response to the West’s confiscation of frozen Russian assets and their transfer to Ukraine. If the seizure is carried out using bonds, then buyers of such securities “will be the first candidates to be subject to countermeasures, including financial and property.” Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova called the possible confiscation “banal theft,” noting that such behavior, however, fits into the paradigm of the “rules-based world order” of the West. On January 16, the head of the Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina, said that the confiscation of the Central Bank’s assets would be a negative signal for central banks of other countries. She assured that Russia will take all necessary measures to protect the legitimate interests of the country. Western countries have tightened sanctions pressure on Russia in connection with the special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to start it was announced on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened. Soon the European Union approved a decision to freeze the assets of the Central Bank.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz delayed making a decision for a long time, but eventually, under pressure from the United States and other NATO members, Scholz announced that Germany was ready to form two tank battalions, and at the first stage Berlin would send a company of 14 tanks. Following Germany's decision, other European countries also announced plans to supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly condemned Western arms supplies to Ukraine and the training of the Ukrainian military in the West, noting that this leads to an escalation of the conflict and makes NATO countries a party to it. Western countries strengthened military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of a Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which the Russian authorities announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

However, the newspaper reports, the weapon is inferior in range to the British Storm Shadow and other missile systems. But at present, the reserves of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are depleted, so Kyiv is also adopting it. They won’t be able to pull it out: the West is trying to prolong the conflict in Ukraine Why the United States and the EU countries need this and who will pay Kyiv’s bills Earlier that day, the head of the department of political analysis and socio-psychological processes of the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, retired colonel Andrei Koshkin indicated that the United States is transferring shells to Ukraine GLSDB to test their performance. According to him, it is planned that these bombs will work with HIMARS and increase the range to 150 km. On January 31, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) Denis Pushilin said that the transfer to Ukraine of GLSDB ammunition with a range of about 150 km only confirms the need for complete demilitarization of the Ukrainian state. A former special forces officer, retired colonel Anatoly Matviychuk told Izvestia that these shells are not anything outstanding, and any Russian air defense system can withstand them. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which began on 24 February 2022. The decision to hold it was made due to the aggravated situation in the region due to increased shelling by Ukrainian troops.

This was stated on November 4 by the head of the main directorate of combat strike systems of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Sergei Baranov, in an interview with the Independent. “We intend to benefit from the experience we have accumulated over previous years and use drones,” the general indicated. In a conversation with the publication, he called on the West to continue supply Ukraine with weapons, despite the Middle East conflict. At the same time, Baranov admitted that the Russian side “has a lot of people and a lot of resources.” Moreover, earlier in November, The National Interest stated that winter could become the main and worst enemy for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, since frosts will worsen the performance of weapons and equipment. In particular, drones such as the DJI Mavic used by the Ukrainian army find it more difficult to operate in cold temperatures, reducing reconnaissance capabilities. “In many areas we manage to improve the tactical situation” Shoigu told Putin about the progress in the special operation zone and assessed the losses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Military expert, retired colonel Anatoly Matviychuk listed the main complaints of the Ukrainian Armed Forces about the weapons supplied by the West. We are talking about the inability of the equipment to the European theater of military operations. He noted that American Abrams tanks cannot climb an ice slide because the clutch slips. Prior to this, on October 19, Jack Watling, a researcher at the British Royal United Institute for Defense Studies, said that Ukraine needs to prepare for a harsh winter due to attacks on facilities infrastructure. He suggested that Russia's superiority over the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the field of material equipment of the army would lead to significant difficulties for Kiev.

Former American intelligence officer Scott Ritter said this on August 1 on the YouTube channel Danny Haiphong. “At this conference, they will take Zelensky’s famous ten-point plan and throw it out the window - that’s my prediction. He’s no good for anything anyway,” he said. According to Ritter, the Ukrainian leader will be forced to abandon today’s demands and make significant concessions. In addition, the American intelligence officer wondered whether the West even needs some kind of frantically developed platform for settlement of the Ukrainian conflict, if they are supposedly already winning on many points.

Among the provisions of the plan are ensuring nuclear, food and energy security, the release of all prisoners of war according to the “all for all” formula, as well as the withdrawal of Russian troops, restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and the creation of an international mechanism to compensate the country for losses from military operations at the expense of Russian assets.

It can even be called not fatigue, but simply some kind of apathy. People run away and hide, no one wants to fight for the regime, these people are caught as best they can,” said Dudchak. However, as the political scientist noted, despite all these processes, the interest of the West, primarily Washington, in Ukraine is unlikely to disappear. “This is a strategic direction. This is not just a hot spot, it is very important for the States, since it is very convenient to create problems for Russia through such hotbeds of tension,” he said. There is a bad thing - there is no good: what overrated equipment does the West supply to Kyiv? A number of samples transferred to Ukraine did not live up to the expectations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Earlier, on January 28, Zelensky, in an interview with the German television channel ARD, admitted the use of force by military registration and enlistment office employees when delivering summonses to men of military age on the streets and in other public places places. He noted that he does not consider this wrong, so a bill on new mobilization rules should be developed.

Ritter noted that the Kiev regime approves strikes on areas where shops and schools are located, which leads to numerous civilian casualties. He also drew attention to the fact that we are talking about deliberate attacks, since the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) have not only NATO weapons, but also intelligence data from the United States of America.

"March 2024","French President Emmanuel Macron, with his statements about the alleged threat from the Russian Federation, creates an atmosphere of fear for French citizens. This was reported by Le Journal du Dimanche on March 3. “The authorities (in Paris. - Ed.) are trying to create fear on the agenda of the upcoming European elections, to polarize the debate so that only the National Rally remains, the constant opponent of the presidential camp,” it follows from the material. In addition, it is noted that such a strategy has already been proven in political circles in France and was actively used, in particular, during the last presidential elections in the country. Mushroom on the horizon: in the West there is talk of sending troops to Ukraine The French President called to prevent Russia from winning. Earlier in the day, The Telegraph newspaper reported that Macron and the elites within the European Union (EU) are seriously panicking against the backdrop of the successes of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation on the contact line. Emmanuel Macron on February 26 announced the possibility of sending Western troops to Ukrainian territory. His words were not supported in Paris. The possibility of sending soldiers from Western countries was also denied in the USA, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, Great Britain, Germany, Lithuania and Canada. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also spoke out against it. In addition, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that there are no such plans. On February 27, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, following Macron, admitted the scenario of sending troops in the future. According to him, France will supposedly be next to Ukraine on Russia’s path. The country’s Ministry of Defense, in turn, explained that Macron’s words are not an attempt to start a war against Russia. And French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejournet said that the country's leadership allows the presence of Western military personnel on the territory of Ukraine to provide some types of assistance, but without their direct participation in the conflict with Russia. After this, the head of the National Rally party faction, Marine Le Pen, criticized the statement on February 27 Macron about the possible sending of troops to Ukraine. Later, on February 29, Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned of tragic consequences if NATO troops were sent to Ukraine. He emphasized that the Russian Federation also has weapons that can hit targets on the territories of the alliance countries. Russophobia, which has blinded Western leaders, is depriving them of reason, Putin emphasized. The West regularly incites hysteria among the citizens of its countries, warning of an allegedly possible imminent war with Russia. Western European media and experts refer to the successes of the Russian military in Ukraine and prophesy that in the future the country will “set off to conquer the whole world.” Meanwhile, back in December last year, Putin called such statements complete nonsense, pointing out that Moscow is ready for any attacks from NATO.

The Hill reported this on Wednesday, April 19. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal noted that after such a briefing he was left with more questions than answers. “I remain deeply dissatisfied and dissatisfied with the structure and access procedures. “My impression from the meeting was that too many people have too much access to too much information without any guarantees or accountability,” he told reporters. Republican Senator Marco Rubio stressed that he still needs to get information about the full extent of the leaks, why they weren't discovered sooner, and how the Pentagon will reduce the likelihood of them occurring in the future. However, even the Pentagon does not know the answers to these questions, the politician believes.

Perhaps he was ordered to do so at gunpoint,” McGregor said. In the Ukrainian troops, salaries of military personnel are not paid, and senior commanders steal compensation for dead soldiers; they are trying to steal everything, the colonel noted. Zaluzhny’s position no longer affects the situation within the army and the conduct of military operations, since the main control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is carried out by foreigners, who give orders to let the Ukrainian military into the fortified positions of the Russian army, McGregor concluded.

"18 December 2023","The wiretapping of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Valeriy Zaluzhny and his colleagues could have been organized both by the Ukrainian side for political reasons and by the Russian side in order to learn about the plans of the enemy command. Political scientist Dmitry Zhuravlev said this on Monday, December 18. According to his fame, Zaluzhny became a very active political figure, so both one and the other could listen to him. “They need to know as much as possible in order to correct Zaluzhny’s actions in time or set him up, blackmail him. Ours could also be wiretapped - it’s reasonable to know what the enemy command wants,” Zhuravlev said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. At the same time, Zhuravlev called the version of espionage on Zaluzhny by his Ukrainian colleagues more likely. He added that it could be all at once: a Western or Ukrainian force is listening to the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and a Russian intelligence officer is working in these forces. “As a result, if the wiretapping was of a political nature, Zaluzhny will begin to better understand who is his friend and who is his enemy. If a military channel is closed, intelligence will look for a new one,” he concluded.

Zaluzhny regarded the installation of a listening device in his office as a war against him and denied the involvement of employees of the Ukrainian General Staff in this. troops, RT reports. On December 18, it became known that a listening device was also found on Zaluzhny’s assistant, Konstantin Bushuev, NSN reports. The Ukrainian publication Strana.ua reported that the devices found may be of Ukrainian origin. The reason for this was a statement by former Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar, who expressed the opinion that constant surveillance is associated with “the specifics of work in responsible government positions.” In early November, after Zaluzhny’s interview with The Economist, in which the general called the Ukrainian conflict a dead end for Kyiv, his relations with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky have worsened. Later, on November 29, the publication wrote that the conflict between the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Ukrainian leader was provoked by the failure of the counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Now, according to the ex-analyst, in addition to Ukraine, NATO will also be demilitarized. “NATO is an instrument of US foreign policy” Interview with Vladimir Putin to Pavel Zarubin. Key quotes Earlier, on February 29, Putin, during his speech to the Federal Assembly, announced the tragic consequences for possible NATO military interventions in Ukraine. At the same time, the president noted that Russophobia blinds the West, depriving it of reason. French President Emmanuel Macron on February 26 announced the possibility of sending Western troops to Ukrainian territory. In turn, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova drew attention to the fact that military personnel from a number of NATO countries have been in Ukraine for a long time and are actively helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) in the operation of weapons. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce aid to Ukraine.

"December 2023","There are no real prerequisites for creating a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine today. And the statements that are heard in the West on this matter are nothing more than a trick, Denis Denisov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, said in a conversation with Izvestia on December 1. The day before, Anatol Lieven, director of the Eurasia program at the Quincy Institute, wrote in an article for the website Russia Matters stated that if the situation in Ukraine does not change in Kyiv’s favor, then Washington will have to agree to peace with Russia. “We are faced with a new narrative that Western adversaries want to “sell” to us. Firstly, there are no real prerequisites for creating a real peace agreement now; neither side has suffered a crushing defeat,” Denisov commented. Secondly, according to him, the countries of the collective West feel a general fatigue with Ukraine. This applies to both the political elites and the population, as evidenced by sociological studies. “In essence, this is a trick, a deception that is designed to entice the Russian political elite into the process of endless negotiations without results. But the most important thing is to understand that as long as Ukraine exists, affiliated with the United States and other Western countries, it is a unique instrument of influence on Russia, and no one will simply give it up or destroy it,” the political scientist emphasized. Well, help: American aid to Ukraine will be revised. The form of support and its content will change, and the amounts will become smaller. On December 1, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky admitted that voices are heard in the West in favor of negotiations with Russia. At the same time, the Ukrainian leader said that so far he does not feel pressure from the West regarding the start of negotiations with Russia, despite the unsuccessful results of the counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). He also told the Associated Press that with the onset of winter, the conflict with Russia had entered a new phase. Prior to this, on November 27, former US Ambassador to NATO and head of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs Ivo Daalder noted that the West should abandon the task of restoring the borders of Ukraine to the military way and focus on providing security guarantees to that part of the country that is still under the control of Kiev. Earlier, on November 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin recalled that Moscow has never abandoned peace negotiations on Ukraine. According to him, any military action is always a tragedy, and it is necessary to “think about how to stop this tragedy.” At the same time, on November 20, Zelensky again opposed holding peace negotiations with Russia, despite the difficult situation of the Ukrainian army. He indicated that he excludes friendship with the Russian Federation. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"December 27 2023","Ukraine's new law on national minorities can only solve the problem of the rights of ethnic Hungarians in Transcarpathia by two-thirds, and even more work will need to be done in this direction. This was stated by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Economic Relations of Hungary Levente Magyar on December 27. He noted that the law adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on December 8 will not be able to provide the Hungarian community in Transcarpathia with the restoration of the rights that the Ukrainian authorities have deprived it of since 2015. “This is far from the same.” a case when they would ideally assess the needs of the Transcarpathian Hungarians and completely eliminate the problems. <...> With this step, about two-thirds of the way has been passed, another third remains to be passed, and then the sharp edges of bilateral relations will disappear,” the Magyar Nemzet newspaper quotes him. The politician explained that for Hungary this law is not a gesture for which one should be grateful, but at least “what should have been expected.” According to him, the Hungarians themselves never harbored any illusions that the rights of representatives of their nation in Transcarpathia would be restored 100%. In addition, Magyar noted that the Ukrainian authorities took such a step only because without it their plans to join the European Union and receive new financial assistance from it would not be realized. You Magyars don’t know well: Hungary does not want to allocate money to Ukraine and accept it into the EU The SBU suspected Orban of collaborating with Russian intelligence services. Prior to this, on December 8, the Ukrainian parliament adopted a bill on national minorities, which tightens restrictions on the use of the Russian language in the country. As Verkhovna Rada deputy Yaroslav Zheleznyak noted at the same time, this bill is aimed at fulfilling the requirements of the European Commission (EC) for the admission of Ukraine to the EU. It was noted that the document also provides for the opportunity for those national minorities whose languages are official in the EU to receive education and distribute propaganda materials in their native language. Earlier, on November 17, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban noted that the situation with the Hungarian language in Transcarpathia under The USSR was better than under Ukraine. According to Orban, Ukraine “continues to punish the Transcarpathians,” so Hungary will provide them with the necessary assistance. In early December, Orban indicated that the EU cannot accept Ukraine into the community for several reasons, but the most important of them is that it is one of most corrupt countries in the world. Later, he recommended that Brussels once again be convinced of the EU’s readiness to accept Ukraine into the unification, taking into account the current situation of the country. On December 18, Alexander Konkov, candidate of political sciences, associate professor of the department of political analysis at the Faculty of Public Administration of Lomonosov Moscow State University, said that Hungary acts as the main violator of EU unity, therefore, Budapest risks receiving various threats from other countries participating in the association. President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky signed an application for the country to join the EU in February 2022. In June of this year, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, announced that at the EU summit Ukraine had agreed on candidate status.

"March 2023","Warsaw will transfer another 10 Leopard tanks to Kyiv this week, Polish Minister of National Defense Mariusz Blaszczak told reporters. “We agreed with the German [Defense] Minister Boris] Pistorius that I will be responsible for creating a coalition of countries that have Leopard 2A4 tanks, and Minister Pistorius - Leopard 2A6 tanks. I made sure that such a coalition was created, 14 Polish tanks, four are already in Ukraine, the next 10 will arrive in Ukraine this week,” he said. According to the minister, Poland is ready to open a service center for the repair of Leopard 2 tanks sent to Ukraine. Such a workshop will be located at the Bumar-Labendy plant in Gliwice. “But there is an important problem - the lack of spare parts. This problem can only be solved by the German defense industry,” Blaszczak added, adding that he intends to discuss this issue with Pistorius at a meeting in Stockholm. Target indication: Ukrainian forces are increasingly losing HIMARS MLRS. The Russian army has found a way to counter this American technology. On February 24, Blaszczak said that Polish Leopard tanks are already in Ukraine. He thanked his colleagues from Norway, Canada, Finland and other countries for the opportunity to form a second Leopard tank battalion. At the end of January, the German government confirmed the decision to send German Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Germany is ready to form two tank battalions; at the first stage, Berlin will send a company of 14 tanks from the Bundeswehr's reserves. Later, on March 7, the representative of the German Ministry of Defense, Arne Collatz, clarified that Berlin would supply German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Kyiv after training the Ukrainian military; there are currently no plans for additional packages. In January, The Economist magazine wrote that the Bundeswehr was in the most worse condition than at any time in history. It was noted that due to the support of Ukraine, the German military departments can barely cope with providing their own army. Moscow has repeatedly condemned Western arms supplies to Ukraine and the training of the Ukrainian military in the West, noting that this leads to an escalation of the conflict and makes NATO countries a party to it. So , On February 17, official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova noted that NATO’s involvement in the conflict in Ukraine has become maximum. He pointed to the provocative activities of Western countries over many years and the direct leadership of the Kyiv regime now. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass.

"December 2023","The Ukrainian economy was held hostage by the blocking of a checkpoint on the country's border with Poland. Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, Minister for Reintegration of Uncontrolled Territories Irina Vereshchuk stated this on December 5. “The blockade on the Polish border has been going on for a month now. Billions of losses for our economy. Neither the Polish authorities nor the European Union can do anything? Do not want? Because the Poles have claims not so much against Ukraine as against the European Union. And the Poles are blocking not so much our border with Poland as our border with the EU. But the Poles have taken the Ukrainian economy hostage,” she wrote on the Telegram channel. Continuing her thoughts, Vereshchuk wondered, “if all of us: Ukraine, the USA, the EU, NATO, Poland, cannot resolve the issue” regarding the Poles’ blockade of the state border , how Ukraine and Western partners can confront Russia. Long-distance with a shadow: what will the new conflict between Ukraine and Poland lead to? The Ukrainian economy is suffocating due to the blockade on the western border. Earlier on this day, it became known about Poland’s concerns due to protests by carriers on the border with Ukraine. Member of the European Parliament (EP) from Poland Leszek Miller addressed the European Commission (EC) with a question about its actions in connection with the protests of Polish carriers on the border with Ukraine. In addition, he asked what measures the EC would take to restore restrictions at border crossings between Ukraine and EU member states. In addition, Tomasz Borkowski, a representative of the committee for the protection of carriers and employers, said that Polish carriers blocking the border with Ukraine threaten to intensify their protest if the government Poland will not solve the problem until Thursday. He stressed that the main demand of the protesters is the restoration of permits for commercial transportation, since after its abolition, 12 thousand transport companies were created in Ukraine over the past year. At the same time, Borkowski did not specify what measures the protesters would take to tighten the protest. In early November, carriers from Poland began to block automobile checkpoints on the border with Ukraine. They demanded the introduction of commercial permits for Ukrainian carriers and limiting their number. Because of this, huge queues of trucks have accumulated at the border. Later, Polish truckers announced that the protest action would continue until February 1 next year. On November 19, it was reported that interruptions in the delivery of some goods began in Ukraine due to the blocking of the border. At the same time, the vice-president of the Association of International Road Carriers (ASMAP) Vladimir Balin said that Kyiv and Warsaw intended to sue over problems with blocking traffic at the border. In addition, on November 24, Demchenko said that the number of trucks on the border of Ukraine and Poland blocked due to a protest by Polish carriers reached 3.7 thousand. President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky on November 25 said that the country is experiencing difficulties on the border with Poland due to for the “political steps” of the neighbors. He indicated that the authorities have already begun to work to resolve the conflict. On the same day, the mayor of Lvov, Andrei Sadovoy, called on Poland to immediately end the “shameful blockade” of the border with Ukraine.

"December 13 2023","Statements by American President Joe Biden on resolving the situation in Ukraine mean that the United States will consider its preservation on the map a “victory.” This was stated by Deputy Head of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev on December 13. The day before, Biden met at the White House with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and announced, among other things, the independent status of Ukraine and its ability to “defend itself today.” “So, according to Biden, “victory” now means that “Ukraine is an independent state” - that is, the victory is that the country will simply remain and not disappear from the world map. Borders and sovereignty do not matter,” Medvedev noted in his Telegram channel. According to Biden’s logic, Ukraine can remain within the borders of Lvov, he clarified. The Deputy Chairman of the Security Council added that in the words of the American leader about the possibility of Ukraine specifically at this moment to protect itself there is no indication of further advance of Ukrainian troops. In addition, it follows from Biden’s words that Ukraine will have to conduct military operations on its own, without the help of the West. Such assessments from the mouth of the US President may actually mean a radical change in the views of the American administration on resolving the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, Medvedev believes. The promise has been delayed for two years: Ukraine is losing US support. What Zelensky and Biden talked about in Washington. The day before, Zelensky visited the United States on an official visit, during which he held a number of meetings - in addition to Biden, with senators and the speaker of the House of Representatives. According to experts, the Ukrainian leader wanted to prove with his trip that he “did everything possible to provide military assistance.” During a meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced the allocation of another package of military assistance to Kyiv in the amount of $200 million, and also expressed the opinion that Ukraine’s entry into NATO is only a matter of time. At the same time, Biden noted that the United States is approaching the loss of its ability to help Ukraine. At the end of October, the Pentagon reported that the total amount of US military support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) during Biden’s tenure as president exceeded $44.5 billion, and since the beginning Russian special military operation - $43.9 billion.

He emphasized that American tanks are driving through Russian territory. “It’s bad, but they drive until a certain point, and then they burn. We will continue to destroy them,” added the Kremlin representative, notes Gazeta.Ru. According to him, the West is playing with fire, discussing the need to send its soldiers to Ukraine.

Prior to this, on February 1, political scientist Ruslan Bortnik expressed the opinion that the President of Ukraine is seeking to achieve the dismissal of Zaluzhny at his own request, since he understands that may face a blow from the Ukrainian public if he himself removes him from the post of commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On the same day, the German newspaper Berliner Zeitung wrote that the United States is more likely to support Zaluzhny than Zelensky if the conflict between them escalates.

And this military issue has nothing to do with the security of the Czech Republic. He mainly talks about how to fight against Russia. This is frightening and alarming, firstly, about his own political credo and, secondly, alarming about what awaits the Czech Republic,” Karasin said.

We are talking about a discussion among senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, a transcript of which was published on March 1 by RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan. During the conversation, the military discussed the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine and a possible strike on the Crimean Bridge. The authors of the material called the interception and publication of the recording a “skillful operation” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which showed his superiority over Scholz. “Putin’s skillful operation left Scholz in the cold. <...> After so many years as Russia's leader, Putin is still an intelligence officer at heart. There is no greater joy than outwitting Russia’s opponents,” the material says. In addition, the journalists emphasized that nothing said by the German military was disinformation on the part of Moscow, Russia only revealed real data, which is why the publication of their negotiations had such an effect. Swan, cancer and Scholz: Germany publicly quarreled with its allies Berlin helped Kyiv with everything, but now it is accused of indifference. In a fragment of an audio recording from representatives of the German Air Force, officers discussed how many Taurus shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether such a strike would be effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr Inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. The day after the leak, March 2, Scholz said, that the authorities are promptly investigating the situation surrounding the publication of a recording of a conversation between German officers in Ukraine. He indicated that what happened was a “very serious problem.” According to him, the incident is being investigated “very carefully, very intensively and very quickly.” Then, on March 4, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that in this case, Germany does not need investigations, but acceptance of responsibility. In turn, Kremlin official representative Dmitry Peskov noted that the recording of negotiations between German officers demonstrates the involvement of Western countries in the conflict in Ukraine. In addition, Moscow hopes to get acquainted with the results of the investigation of the German authorities on this topic, he added. Later that same day, in connection with what happened on March 4, the German Ambassador to Russia Alexander Lambsdorff was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. A diplomatic source told Izvestia that during communication with the ambassador at the department, in addition to discussing the recording of the conversation, “other issues will be touched upon.” The German diplomat stayed in the ministry building for more than an hour and then left it without answering journalists’ questions. The Ukrainian side is making attempts to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, since it is dangerous to involve Germany in the conflict Share: if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1660181'); } else { document.addEventListener('recommendationRunInit', function() { if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1660181'); } }); }",2024-03-20

"March 2024","The Arbitration Court of the Republic of Crimea registered a claim for recovery of budget damage caused by the energy blockade of the peninsula by Ukraine. Chairman of the State Council of the Republic of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov announced this on March 4 in his Telegram channel. “The volume of our claims is more than 3 trillion 156 billion rubles. For us, this is a very significant event, a serious result of the work we have done,” Konstantinov wrote. He added that Crimea will continue to formulate its claims against Ukraine and Western countries that sponsor the crimes of the Kyiv regime against the republic and its inhabitants, and this work will be brought to logical conclusion. “We will count all the damage caused to us down to the penny,” Konstantinov promised. Not forgotten old: why Russia filed a complaint against Ukraine with the ECHR What Moscow's appeal to the Strasbourg court could turn out for Kyiv Earlier, on March 1, Konstantinov announced the filing of this claim. He said that there is a special working group in the republic that calculates the damage caused by Ukraine to the peninsula. The day before, Konstantinov wrote that the energy blockade of Crimea was carried out by the decision of the then-current President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, although he was not the initial link in the chain of these decisions. According to Aksenov, the authorities in Kyiv were instructed from the United States. Co-chairman of the special working group, head of the legislation committee of the Crimean parliament, Sergei Trofimov, commenting on the pending lawsuit against Ukraine, said that the Public Chamber of Crimea is also preparing lawsuits from all citizens who suffered losses due to for energy blockades. Among the defendants, Trofimov named the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the country's Ministry of Energy and the Ukrenergo company. At the same time, the Arbitration Court of Crimea on July 3, 2023 opened proceedings on a claim for compensation for damage from the blockade filed by the Crimean government. In October, it was decided to recover 152 billion rubles from Ukraine for this claim. Crimea became part of Russia following a referendum in 2014. At that time, 96.77% of residents of the peninsula and 95.6% of voters in Sevastopol were in favor of joining the Russian Federation. Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the procedure was carried out in strict accordance with international law. After the referendum, Kyiv closed the locks of the North Crimean Canal, which covered up to 85% of Crimea’s fresh water needs. Also, as part of the blockade in November 2015, power line towers were blown up in the Kherson region and the power supply to Crimea was cut off, but as a result of the accelerated commissioning of two stages of the energy bridge from Russia to Crimea in December of the same year, the problem with the lack of electricity on the peninsula was generally resolved.

"13 April 2023","Ukrainian officials are outraged by the pessimism of the US military-political leadership in assessing the chances of success of the Ukrainian counter-offensive, given in secret documents leaked to the Internet after the leak of Pentagon data. The Politico newspaper reported this on April 13, citing high-ranking Ukrainian officials. “Ukrainian officials are beside themselves over the leak of classified US intelligence documents, some of which are classified “Top Secret,” the publication says. As the newspaper’s source noted, Kiev officials What's annoying is not so much the assessment of the readiness and resilience of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) or comments about the shortage of weapons, including air defense missiles (ADM), as the pessimism about the chances of the AFU to seize significant territories. Politico reported that despite statements of mutual trust between Washington and Kiev, data from published documents indicate growing distrust of the Ukrainian authorities at the level of the Pentagon and the US National Security Council. In addition, one of the Ukrainian commanders told the publication that Ukraine does not share with the United States all the information about the counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The leak does not work: who benefits from the leaks of American intelligence agencies The version of disinformation does not stand up to criticism The leak of two large batches of secret Pentagon documents became known on April 6. We are talking about approximately 100 documents that relate to Kyiv’s combat capabilities, NATO support and the vulnerability of the Ukrainian army. It also follows from documents leaked online that the United States is listening in on South Korea, Israel, and Ukraine. Against this backdrop, several countries demanded an explanation from the United States. On April 10, Reuters, citing the Pentagon, reported that the leak could become the most destructive publication of US government information since the publication of documents on WikiLeaks in 2013. In turn, White House Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby said that the United States cannot yet answer the question of whether the leak of secret Pentagon documents has been eliminated or whether more materials may appear on the Internet. He also stated that there is no single version of the leak of secret Pentagon documents. The Politico newspaper noted on April 10 that Washington is trying to resolve the situation with the data leak. Representatives of American intelligence services, the State Department and the Pentagon turned to their foreign colleagues to allay their concerns. An investigation is currently underway, during which experts are trying to determine the culprits and the amount of information disclosed. Director of the Institute of Political Studies, member of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation, Sergei Markov, in a conversation with Izvestia, noted that US NATO allies will not find anything surprising in those leaked online secret American documents. In his opinion, they already know everything perfectly well. At the same time, he called for caution regarding information about a possible counter-offensive by Ukraine. The US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the leak of secret documents. The Fox News channel reported that the leak of secret documents could not have come from the Pentagon, but from the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA ) or the National Security Agency (NSA). On April 11, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, commenting on statements that the leak of Pentagon documents was disrupting plans for a Ukrainian counteroffensive, said that Kiev has the ability to attack. Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) of Ukraine Alexey Danilov said that the leak of classified Pentagon materials would not affect Kyiv’s military strategy, including counteroffensive plans. Meanwhile, on April 13, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre noted that the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with all the necessary support for combat operations Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal said on April 11 that the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces could begin in the summer. According to him, Kyiv does not feel pressure from the West regarding a counter-offensive, since Western “friends” understand the importance of fully preparing the Ukrainian army. In turn, the head of the department of political analysis and socio-psychological processes of the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, Andrei Koshkin, allowed Ukraine to lie about postponing the counter-offensive for summer.

"24 February 2023","Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene submitted a resolution to Congress demanding that the White House provide complete information on all documents related to the transfer of military assistance to Ukraine. RIA Novosti reported this on February 24 with reference to the text of the document. Warsaw style: what Biden promised during his speech in Poland And how the American president’s tour is connected with the US elections The politician addresses not only US President Joe Biden, but also Pentagon head Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “The President is asked, The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State are directed to transmit to the House of Representatives copies of all documents, schedules or tables, including meeting notes, audio recordings, telephone conversations and email messages,” the document states. Greene also demanded copies of financial documents detailing recipients and government expenses associated with funds allocated by Congress to Ukraine. We are talking about military, civilian and financial assistance provided in the period from January 20, 2021 to February 24, 2023. Earlier on Friday, Pentagon chief Austin said that the United States and its allies provided ammunition to the Ukrainians , weapons systems and training worth billions of dollars since the conflict began. At the same time, $29.8 billion came from the United States alone. Earlier, on February 18, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing Pentagon representatives, that the United States plans to send auditors to the combat zone in Ukraine to monitor the use of multibillion-dollar military aid. In early February Republican Party representative Matt Gaetz said during a meeting of the House of Representatives that Washington is spending tens of billions of dollars on Ukraine to fuel a conflict that does not serve US national interests. In his opinion, the White House violates its own “red lines” every day, supplying Kyiv with increasingly powerful weapons. The United States and Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass. The decision was made by Russian President Vladimir Putin amid a worsening situation in the region as a result of shelling by Ukrainian forces.

"April 2023","French President Emmanuel Macron believes China can play an important role in the situation around Ukraine thanks to its strong ties with Russia. He stated this during an official trip to China on April 5, speaking to the local French community. “China, which has strong ties with Russia, which have been reaffirmed in recent days, can play an important role,” Macron said. The French leader arrived in China earlier in the day. Macron's visit will last from April 5 to 8. This is his third official trip to China. We travel as a couple: why Emmanuel Macron took the head of the European Commission to Beijing And what to expect from negotiations on the Ukrainian topic At the same time, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will visit China. Shi Zhiqing, head of the program on relations between China and the European Union at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, expressed the opinion that the purpose of their visit would be an attempt to convince Chinese leader Xi Jinping to put pressure on Moscow and align the positions of Beijing and Brussels. A day earlier, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning confirmed their readiness China to discuss a political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis with the European Union. In February, China published a document with a position on a political settlement of the situation in Ukraine. Among the main points are the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, the resumption of direct dialogue between Moscow and Kiev, as well as a call to prevent further escalation. The Russian side stated that it respects the Chinese peace plan to resolve the Ukrainian conflict, which in turn causes irritation in the West.

"17 November 2023","Political scientist Yuri Svetov, in a conversation with Izvestia on November 17, rejected the possibility of a third Maidan in Ukraine. Earlier on Friday, Bloomberg reported that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky fears that the country is preparing a third Maidan. According to him, the operation is allegedly organized by Russia. According to Svetov, there cannot be a third Maidan in Ukraine, especially by pro-Russian forces. “If we remember the history of the Maidans, they were not organized by Russia. That at the time when [former head of Ukraine Viktor] Yushchenko became president, there was the first Maidan, that the Maidan, which was organized in 2013, these were Maidans created by anti-Russian forces, this is their technology,” the political scientist noted. Moreover, Russia does not have the forces in Ukraine that could speak out in its support, and today it is difficult to imagine that in Ukrainian society there will be people ready to take to the streets demanding Zelensky’s resignation, the expert added. “He (Zelensky. - Ed. ) simply feels that the chair under him is on fire. He is afraid that it is not the Maidan that is possible, but a conspiracy of the military, who, having received the go-ahead from the United States, can remove him, so he insists ahead of time that everything that will be done against him is pro-Russian intrigues,” Svetov said . There will be no breakthrough: Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny spoke about positional struggle In an essay for a British publication, the Ukrainian general made a number of compliments to Russian weapons. The previous two political crises in Ukraine, called “Maidan,” took place in 2004 and 2013–2014. During them, the country's leadership changed. Earlier, on November 6, former CIA analyst Larry Johnson said that Zelensky's actions could provoke a military coup in the country. According to him, Kiev sees a lack of interest on the part of the United States, but the Ukrainian leader shows isolation from reality and denies the difficult situation of the army in the combat zone. In early November, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), Valery Zaluzhny, told The Economist magazine that the troops were not can achieve a breakthrough, since the conflict has reached a dead end. In turn, Zelensky did not agree with the opinion of the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but admitted that the offensive of the Ukrainian army is difficult due to the fact that Russian forces control the skies.

"March 2024","The conflict between Warsaw and Kyiv over the blocking of Ukrainian cargo at the border could lead to Poland limiting itself exclusively to military-technical cooperation with Kiev. Political scientist Dmitry Zhuravlev said this on Monday, March 4. He added that for Poland the economy of its own country is more important than support for Ukraine. The political scientist noted that Poland is ready to help Ukraine in the fight against Russia, but not to pay for it by destroying its economy. “As long as there was no grain topic, Warsaw was ready to support Kyiv, but as soon as the topic of money arises, friendship quickly disappears. Poland is too dependent on its farmers: they are the main voters. If you don’t react to their position, then you won’t be able to come to an agreement with your own country, and the government will begin to change too often,” the political scientist said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. He added that if Poland reduces all cooperation with Ukraine exclusively to the military-technical format , for Kyiv this is extremely unprofitable, since the country was also counting on economic support. The border is locked: Poland has threatened to stop the transit of goods from Ukraine. According to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, such a measure will be painful for both countries. The day before, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that the situation on the border between Ukraine and Poland has gone beyond the bounds of morality, NSN reports. He noted that the Polish authorities should not use the situation in Ukraine “in the internal political struggle,” RT reports. Earlier, on March 3, it became known that protesting Polish farmers blocked equipment for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) on the border with Ukraine. Ukrainians also complained that Polish farmers also break the windows of cars that are transported to Ukraine for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Polish farmers blocked all six border crossings on the border with Ukraine as a sign of protest. On the same day, Senator Alexei Pushkov also reported that on the border of Poland and Ukraine, rioting farmers began to beat cars with Ukrainian license plates that were parked in a convoy, the cars of which were purchased in Europe with Ukrainian volunteers for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Prior to this, on March 1, it became known that law enforcement officers in Poland did not allow Ukrainian drivers stuck in the country to hold a protest on the common border of the two states. On February 26, Politico journalists talked with Ukrainian drivers stuck at the border in Poland. They are angry that they cannot return to their country. The driver, who cannot leave for 22 days, said that he was transporting juice boxes to Odessa, where factory production was idle without them. Another carrier complained that he hadn't showered in weeks. He thought that the Poles are friends of Ukraine, but this situation is a “knife in the back.” Polish farmers systematically block roads in Poland. On March 1, they blocked local highway No. 15 and demanded a meeting with the country's Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The farmers are demanding that the government introduce an embargo on the supply of agricultural products to Ukraine and the state’s withdrawal from the European Union’s Green Deal program, which concerns the achievement of carbon neutrality in the alliance countries by 2050. Tusk, in turn, on February 29 threatened to close the border with Ukraine if Kiev and Brussels did not pay attention to the problems of Warsaw. Two days earlier, 2.1 thousand stranded heavy trucks were counted at six checkpoints on the common border of the two states who could not leave due to blocked checkpoints. Polish carriers and farmers began blocking automobile checkpoints on the border with Ukraine in early November last year. Among their demands was the introduction of commercial permits for Ukrainian carriers and a limit on the number of Ukrainian heavy trucks entering Poland.

In his opinion, this decision should be confirmed at the summit in Vilnius in July. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on June 28 that the alliance at the summit in Vilnius, which will take place on July 11–12, will strengthen political ties with Ukraine and agree on a multi-year assistance package that will bring the country closer to its rightful place in NATO.

At the same time, the Ukrainian leader emphasized that he has a full understanding of the country’s security guarantees until joining the alliance.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the US Senate, said this on February 11. “Ukraine is alarmingly short of supplies. If America doesn't send aid to Ukraine with this national security bill, Putin will likely succeed,” he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Schumer called for passage of the Ukraine aid bill as soon as possible. Supplies are at a standstill: what critical weapons could Kyiv be left without? Reducing Western aid not only deprives Ukraine of the ability to attack, but also reduces its defense capabilities. On February 8, US President Joe Biden emphasized that the conflict in Ukraine is at a critical point due to reduced support from Western countries, which, led by the United States, must increase assistance. Earlier, on February 7, the US Senate blocked a bill with provisions for protecting US borders, within its framework it was planned to allocate a $60 billion aid package to Ukraine. One of the most active opponents of this bill was former US President and candidate in the upcoming presidential election Donald Trump. The bill was blocked three days after its presentation. Prior to this, on February 5, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky noted that military operations are in a state of stagnation and Western countries are to blame for this, which are delaying arms supplies. According to him, it is not enough for the Ukrainian army to receive only shells; it also needs military equipment. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues.

"April 2023","The United States sent tanks designed for a “third world war with Russia” to Ukraine as part of a new package of military support. Maya Karlin, a columnist for the 19fortyfive portal, wrote about this on Sunday, April 9. The journalist said that by the end of the 1950s, rumors began to spread that the USSR was developing an improved tank that could carry a high-speed rifled gun. To keep up with its rival's new T-54/T-55 combat vehicles, Washington began building its XM60 prototype. The US has now included the M60 tank in an upcoming arms delivery to Kyiv. “However, these tanks will be unarmed versions of the M60. Like tank bridgelayers, these tanks are designed to build bridges across narrow terrain and water obstacles in just three minutes,” the author said. NATO decided: the alliance announced new arms supplies to Kyiv. Do the countries of the bloc have weapons capable of turning the tide, and how do such decisions affect the prospects of the negotiation process? Earlier, on April 4, the Pentagon announced the allocation of new military assistance to Kyiv in the amount of $2.6 billion. As part of the first part of the assistance, Kyiv will be given from Pentagon stocks ammunition for the Patriot anti-aircraft missile system, HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems, artillery shells, ammunition for tanks, about 400 grenade launchers and about 200 thousand ammunition for them. In addition, according to the second part of the package, Ukraine will also receive ammunition for NASAMS systems, anti-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipment, air surveillance radars, anti-aircraft ammunition and missile shells, Grad missiles, as well as ammunition for mortars and Javelin anti-tank systems. According to the Russian Embassy in the United States , the allocation of a new package of military assistance to Kyiv is a step towards the escalation of hostilities in Ukraine. The diplomatic mission called on the American leadership to think about the risks of expanding geography. On April 5, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that since the beginning of the special operation, the United States has allocated more than $35 billion in military assistance to Ukraine, including a new package of weapons. The diplomat pointed out that Western countries continue to pump Ukraine with weapons and do everything to make the Ukrainian crisis “as long and bloody as possible.” Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass. Moscow has repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Ukraine.

Earlier, Wang Yi pointed out the strength of Chinese-Russian relations, calling them solid as a rock. After the meeting with Patrushev, he emphasized that the PRC and Russia, as members of the UN Security Council, are responsible for peace on the planet.

The authors recall that the S-400 has in the past shown the ability to intercept missiles at a speed of Mach 8, and the trajectories of surface-to-air missiles are far from the most complex, so the advantages are obvious. Moreover, Russian forces could potentially benefit from suppressing missiles fired by Patriot SAMs. “Russian-made missiles are not only about half the price of missiles fired by a US-supplied system, but the missile inventory for such systems like the S-400 is substantially larger.” the amount of ammunition that was supplied to the Ukrainians in Patriot batteries,” the article noted. “Dagger” attack: how the Russian Armed Forces destroyed the most modern US air defense The Patriot anti-aircraft missile system in Kiev demonstrated an inability to defend itself, military experts say.

The New York Times reported on October 27. “The Democratic Party's decades-long unity in support of President Biden is beginning to fray over his strong support for Israel as the war with the Palestinians escalates, with a coalition of young voters and left-leaning people of color expressing more dissatisfaction. than ever since his election,” the media notes. The newspaper writes that while moderate Democrats supported the American leader’s intention to help Israel, liberal representatives of the party at protests and in open letters demanded that Biden “abandon the American policy pursued for decades and call for a ceasefire.” At the same time, the real strength of Biden’s opponents in the Democratic Party is quite difficult to determine, since their actions “are scattered.” However, the country’s president no longer feels the same enthusiasm about his re-election by fellow party members. “His margin in key states was only a few thousand votes. This is unlikely to be enough to avoid a significant exodus of young voters, who are repulsed by his loyalty to Israel's right-wing government. Crisis control: what goals are the United States pursuing in the Middle East conflict? The White House faces the need to solve a number of difficult problems.

At the same time, the head of the European Council emphasized that countries will discuss the Palestinian-Israeli conflict “without being distracted from Ukraine.” The EU will continue its support as long as necessary, Michel added. “I would like us to focus on concrete ways to speed up the provision of military support, progress in our plans to use Russia's immobilized assets,” the head of the European Council wrote.

Kremlin official representative Dmitry Peskov told reporters about this on September 22. “We see that there are certain frictions between Warsaw and Kiev, we predict that these tensions between Warsaw and Kiev will increase. We note with regret that both capitals are now the main focus of Russophobia; we, of course, are closely monitoring this,” Peskov said. He emphasized that the Kremlin understands that a certain degree of tension will also grow between Kiev and other capitals of Europe. escalation in relationships. According to the Kremlin official representative, this is inevitable. “In the meantime, we are continuing our special military operation to fulfill the tasks that we ourselves have set for us,” said the head of state’s press secretary. Raising the stakes: how Kyiv and Warsaw quarreled Why formally good relations between neighbors turned out to be strained in practice Earlier that day, adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, Mikhail Podolyak, called the disagreements on the issue of exporting agricultural products between the country's leadership and Poland temporary. Podolyak expressed confidence that after the elections, the dialogue with Warsaw will return to calm and we will resolve problems related to arms supplies and commercial issues. Peskov also noted on August 2 that in the future, contradictions between Poland and Ukraine will grow. According to him, the Poles have many claims to Ukraine, because various historical events also left a deep imprint on the modern nature of their relations. Peskov then noted that Russia would watch this, since Kyiv “stands at the center of the entire Russophobic movement,” and Warsaw is also not particularly friendly towards the Russian Federation.

"31 December 2023","Current Ukraine is a zombie state that survives only through external support and replenishment, and when it comes to an end, this country simply will not exist. Political scientist Bogdan Bezpalko said this on December 31 in a conversation with Izvestia. “As soon as this support begins to decline, crisis phenomena will begin there, then the state will die. In fact, Ukraine now rather resembles a “dead man in the crowd,” who stands only because people are supporting him on all sides,” the expert noted. According to Bezpalko, Ukraine uses weapons that Russia cannot afford to use—this the destruction of civilians, both their own and Russia’s, as evidenced by the attack on Belgorod. Moreover, such methods are used only in order to receive new help from the West and to attract the attention of the media to such “actions”, which are actively discussing them. However, such strikes do not have any military purpose. “Ukrainian missiles and drones are striking directly at residential areas, as was the case in Belgorod. We cannot afford this. Obviously, the simplest and most adequate answer now would be the destruction of Ukraine’s infrastructure and its military potential. Because such “actions” will not save Ukraine, and for Russia this is a very painful injection, since civilians are dying,” the expert concluded. With eyes tightly closed: with its silence, the West supported Ukrainian terrorist attacks against civilians. Europe and the United States did not condemn the shelling of civilians in a day. Earlier on the same day, political scientist Pyotr Kolchin, in an interview with Izvestia, expressed the opinion that after the terrorist attack on Belgorod Russia can strike back at Ukraine, but this is not in the traditions of the Russian mentality. Russia does not use terror and attacks against civilians to achieve its goals or the goals of any other states, Kolchin pointed out. The day before, December 30, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) struck the center of Belgorod. Based on the attack, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened a case under articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation “Attempted murder”, “Murder”, “Deliberate destruction/damage of property”. According to the latest data, 24 people were killed and over 100 residents were injured as a result of the shelling. There are children among the victims. In response to the terrorist attack in Ukraine, on the night of December 31, the Russian Armed Forces struck decision-making centers and military facilities in Kharkov.

"13 October 2023","Deputy Director of the Institute of Strategic Studies and Forecasts of the RUDN University, member of the Public Chamber (PC) of Russia Nikita Danyuk commented on Friday, October 13, on the statement of the adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Mikhail Podolyak, that the failure of the counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) is associated with long supplies of weapons from Western countries. The analyst also predicted that in the winter Ukraine would most likely go on the defensive and there would be no talk of any offensive actions. “Ukrainian society was inside an information bubble of propaganda that they (the Armed Forces of Ukraine . - Ed.) are advancing successfully and that Western help will almost help reach Crimea - reality comes to people not through news, but through friends and close relatives, who in this counter-offensive played the role of just cannon fodder,” he said in a conversation. with RT, adding that society needs to be given the culprit for this failure. According to Danyuk, no one will say that initially Zelensky’s plan and the actions of Ukrainian military leaders were doomed to failure. A member of the OP noted that Podolyak’s message was aimed at an internal audience in order to to try to stop discontent within the country. “We need to show that there is a certain West, which, on the one hand, helps, on the other hand, if it helped much more effectively, if weapons and ammunition were delivered more quickly, then we would be able to demonstrate something "", - he said. Signal to cover: the Russian army is trying to encircle Avdiivka The liberation of this city will reduce the intensity of shelling of Donetsk Earlier, on October 12, Podolyak accused Western countries of failing the counteroffensive due to the long supply of weapons to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which in Kyiv is called “falling behind the schedule,” NSN reports. According to Podolyak, when the Kyiv authorities in the fall of last year, 2022, were actively begging for weapons from the West, Western partners “were still afraid to admit that it was necessary to provide everything that Ukraine needed as quickly as possible.” According to him, according to the agreement, Kyiv could receive supplies through three weeks, and ultimately received it after two to three months, reports the 360 TV channel. At the same time, Podolyak did not explain why the Ukrainian leadership, despite such a “fall off schedule,” still announced the start of a counteroffensive, which led to tens of thousands of dead mobilized Ukrainians. Earlier that day, the head of the main intelligence department of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Kirill Budanov, admitted that the Ukrainian army “got behind schedule” in plans for conducting military operations. In addition, answering the journalist’s clarifying question, Budanov noted that “not everything went wrong.” He did not explain what he meant when he spoke about the schedule.

Military expert retired colonel Viktor Litovkin told Izvestia about this on August 18. “Firstly, in order to fly an airplane, you need to study for a long time. It’s not easy to take off and land at an airfield, but you need to be able to pilot it alone, in a pair, in a flight, in a squadron, to conduct an air battle - you need to learn this for at least a year and a half. While Ukrainian pilots are being taught this, the military operation could end unfavorably for Ukraine,” he said. In addition, the F-16 needs an equipped airfield, Litovkin noted. “Not just a runway, because you can take off and land from a decent highway, but we need a command tower where they will direct the flight, we need serious radar stations that will see planes ahead, to the right, to the left and many kilometers further, in order to warn the pilot what targets are in the air, where to fly, and so on,” - he explained. Ukraine also needs a technical and operational part, where they will prepare aircraft for takeoff and service them after the flight, Izvestia’s interlocutor emphasized. “We need a plant for the production of high-pressure air, we need a plant for purifying aviation kerosene, we need warehouses for missiles.” air - air"", ""air - surface"".

In mid-February, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that The White House is concerned about possible assistance from China to Russia in conducting military operations in Ukraine. The diplomat warned China of the consequences if it provides material assistance to Russia in a special military operation.

"14 August 2023","The short-sighted decisions of the Ukrainian authorities became a serious reason why citizens of the country began to leave the country for permanent residence. Verkhovna Rada deputy from the Servant of the People faction Georgiy Mazurashu stated this on August 14. He did not rule out that the population of Ukraine could already be reduced to 20 million people, and this is not at all because the country is in a state of military conflict. “To be honest, , we as authorities also contribute to this. “Emotional and unwise decisions and actions,” the Ukrainian News publication quotes the deputy. According to Mazurash, the majority of Ukrainians do not want to return to the country, since the authorities have begun to treat their citizens as slaves. He also continued that the country “due to the unconstitutional and unwise decision to ban the travel of men aged 18 to 60 years” was left without serious income to the economy - foreign exchange inflow from the so-called migrant workers who went to work abroad, and upon returning exchanged their earnings foreign money into hryvnia. In addition, he pointed out that Ukraine will inevitably face a demographic problem in the near future, and therefore it is necessary to begin taking appropriate measures. In particular, the deputy proposed to legislatively condemn the intentions to force men into the army through coercion and threats, and begin to increase the motivation for those participating in hostilities in other, more adequate ways. Game of extinction: Ukraine is at the center of a demographic catastrophe The country's population is rapidly declining Earlier, on March 16, former adviser to ex-President Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin said that the situation in Ukraine is on the verge of a revolutionary explosion. According to him, Kyiv has already virtually gone bankrupt and lost 60% of its economic complex, the hryvnia is maintained only thanks to internal and external reserves, and the social structure of Ukrainian society is torn due to the emigration of 11 million people from the country. On March 13, Soskin said that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky allowed Western countries to deceive the people of the country. While the Armed Forces (AFU) are in a difficult situation, Kyiv’s allies are only promising supplies of new weapons, but are in no hurry to provide the necessary support.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said this on Monday, July 10. “We do not believe that this issue is capable of provoking a split in unity with our allies and partners. <...> We also believe that this decision is not capable of affecting the further provision of support to Ukraine from various countries,” he said during a briefing broadcast on the YouTube channel. Miller emphasized that Kyiv has made a commitment to the United States clear unexploded cluster munitions after the end of hostilities.

"12 April 2023","Ukraine is in vain counting on the support of Western countries, since they may not be able to provide it. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky should agree to a peaceful resolution to the conflict before he completely loses his right to vote. A corresponding opinion was expressed by South China Morning Post columnist Daniel Covani. “Ukrainian leaders must swallow their pride and make peace before the last vestiges of their leverage disappear and they have no say in the final outcome of the conflict and its consequences,” noted he. Since the beginning of the conflict, Kyiv has mistakenly believed that it needs to improve its position in negotiations with Russia, stalling for time and relying on Western promises for help. Now Ukraine has lost a significant part of its territory, infrastructure, equipment and workforce. The longer the fighting goes on, the more the country will need reconstruction, which Western countries will hardly be able to pay for, Kovani pointed out. Already, he clarified, the Western production capacity does not allow providing the necessary degree of military assistance to Ukraine. “Until there is a corresponding decision from the United States, there will be no negotiations” Former Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov - about the possibility of dialogue between Moscow and Kyiv, further supplies of Western weapons and corruption in the country As Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov noted on April 7 at a meeting with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu, negotiations on a settlement in Ukraine can only be carried out on the basis of taking into account Russian interests. Lavrov stressed that Russia has repeatedly said that it does not refuse negotiations. At the same time, Western statements on peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine are “unclean tactics,” he added. On the same day, Chinese President Xi Jinping, at an informal dinner with French President Emmanuel Macron in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, noted that prolongation of the Ukrainian crisis harms all countries . A political settlement is the only correct way out of the situation, he said. The day before, the head of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Leonid Slutsky, said that Moscow does not exclude the possibility of resolving the Ukrainian conflict peacefully, but the decision must be made taking into account changing territorial realities. According to him, any negotiations with the Ukrainian side should be carried out taking into account the fact that the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, as well as the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions and Crimea are full-fledged regions of the Russian Federation. Moreover, on April 4, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, said that Russia does not yet see any prospects for resuming Russian-Ukrainian negotiations. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced this on Wednesday, January 31, ahead of a bilateral meeting with Executive Vice Presidents of the European Commission (EC) Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis. “Europe has been a key partner in attempts to impose increasing costs on Russia through the introduction of multiple packages of sanctions. , introducing a new cap on oil prices and taking harsh measures against sanctions evasion,” she said in a statement published on the website of the country’s Ministry of Finance. The official noted that in Ukraine, financial support is inextricably linked with success on the battlefield, so it cannot be allowed so that it runs out of money before it runs out of weapons. “Together, the United States, the European Commission and EU member states have provided Ukraine with more than $54 billion in direct budget support since 2022, with more than half coming from the European Commission and EU member states,” Yellen said. According to her, the American presidential administration is firmly committed to its request to Congress to provide additional support for Ukraine in the amount of $11.8 billion. “We will continue to call on Congress to act, and we are proud to support our European partners in this vital work,” the official concluded. We have reached an impasse: the United States cannot agree on further assistance to Kyiv. Republicans linked the issue of supporting Ukraine with the topic of combating illegal migration to the United States. On January 27, columnist Anne Applebaum wrote in The Atlantic magazine that the gradual weakening of American assistance to Ukraine creates more and more doubts about its resumption, and problems with Congress and the allocation of funds threaten to make the United States a truly unreliable, frivolous and stupid ally. On January 22, the leader of the Democratic majority in the upper house, Chuck Schumer, said that Democrats and Republicans in the US Senate have not yet been able to agree on the allocation of aid to Ukraine and tightening control over southern American border. Earlier that day, John Kirby, the coordinator for strategic communications at the White House National Security Council (NSC), said that the next few months will be critical for Ukraine as much of its weapons are depleted, but the United States is committed to the strategy of supporting Kyiv and will continue help him. Prior to this, on January 16, American Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States does not have a “magic pot” from which it could finance Ukraine without coordinating requests in Congress. He recognized as a “real problem” a situation in which Congress would not approve financial support for Kiev. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by the Russian President on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened from -for shelling by the Ukrainian military.

Save private Biden: why Kyiv is tightening mobilization And how the recruitment of 500 thousand people into the Armed Forces of Ukraine affects the presidential campaign in the United States The bill on the procedure for mobilization in Ukraine was submitted to the Verkhovna Rada on January 30. It provides for the distribution of electronic summons to a special conscript office, which will become mandatory for all those liable for military service. It also spells out new measures for those who do not appear at the military registration and enlistment office, for example, banning draft dodgers from traveling abroad and blocking their bank cards and driver’s licenses. On February 6, Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak announced that parliament had reduced the deadline for submitting alternative bills on mobilization. In addition, the Parliament of Ukraine extended martial law in the country for 90 days - from February 14 to May 13. Later, on February 7, the Verkhovna Rada approved a bill tightening the procedure for mobilization in the state. On February 8, Ukrainian MP Alexey Goncharenko (included in the list of terrorists and extremists Rosfinmonitoring) said that the bill to tighten mobilization in Ukraine is a deception of people. According to him, leaving the rule on demobilization after 36 months of service only after a decision by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief “means never letting people go.” Martial law in Ukraine has been in effect since February 2022. At the same time, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization. Later, the Verkhovna Rada repeatedly extended its validity. Most men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country.

"19 February 2023","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the head of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC Central Committee), Wang Yi, about the consequences if the PRC provides material assistance to Russia in a special military operation in Ukraine. The State Department announced this on February 18. Pulling the tiger's whiskers: why are Americans angering China again? The US decided to repeat the scandalous visit of the Speaker of the House of Representatives to Taiwan “The Secretary of State warned of the consequences if China provides material assistance to Russia (in a special military operation in Ukraine. - Ed.) or support in a systemic bypass sanctions,"" the statement said. Earlier in the day, Antony Blinken met with Wang Yi on the sidelines of the 59th Munich Security Conference. In the conversation, the US Secretary of State emphasized that Washington will not tolerate a violation of its sovereignty under any circumstances. During the meeting, bilateral relations were discussed, as well as the Ukrainian conflict, the launch of a ballistic missile by the PRC and the situation in Taiwan. Also on February 18, at the Munich conference, German Foreign Minister Annalena Bärbock called on China to use its influence to achieve peace in the conflict in Ukraine. In turn, Wang Yi said that Beijing would prepare a document outlining its position on a political settlement of the conflict in Ukraine by the end of February. On February 4, Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, following a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, said that China intends to continue to develop bilateral relations with Russia to achieve common regional and international goals. The meeting took place from February 2 to 3. Representatives of the two countries noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chairman of the Chinese People's Party Xi Jinping managed to maintain Russian-Chinese relations at a high level “even in the new era.” In turn, on February 2, the Russian Foreign Minister, during a meeting with Ma Zhaoxu, noted high level of relations between China and Russia. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on January 20 that China will continue to work to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. According to him, the country has always actively worked to promote peace negotiations, and Beijing will continue to “play a constructive role in a peaceful solution to the crisis” in its own ways. On November 2, the El País newspaper wrote that Western countries have nothing to offer China in order for it to turn away from the Russian Federation, without harming its own “democratic values, interests or security.” The authors pointed out that Beijing and Moscow have similar goals in the geopolitical arena and they are unanimous in the position that NATO is the cause of all problems. Prior to this, on October 30, the Chinese leader stated that relations between Russia and China demonstrate a high level of sustainable development. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in turn, emphasized that Russia is interested in strengthening relations with China in every possible way. In addition, he noted that the countries share approaches on most pressing issues in the international arena. The special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"18 June 2023","This year the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) have only one opportunity for a counter-offensive. Czech President Petr Pavel said this on June 18 in an interview with CNN prima news. “I said that Ukraine has one chance to carry out a counter-offensive this year, because if the counter-offensive, which we are obviously witnessing, would unsuccessful, then it will not be possible to prepare a second counter-offensive, which is fundamental for the outcome of the conflict, for objective reasons,” Pavel emphasized. He believes that the result of the actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces this year could be negotiations to end the conflict or the transition of hostilities to the freezing stage. This state of affairs, Pavel believes, will last until next year, when Ukraine will be able to gather new forces for a further counter-offensive. “If I look at what is happening as a former soldier, then, firstly, [I will say] that the Russian army has mastered the experience of the Ukrainian attacks that began last year and at the same time very intensively carried out the construction of several defensive lines. It is plausible that the goal of the current stage of the [UAF] counter-offensive is to find weak points in this defense. What we see next will be the result of how the Ukrainian side evaluates [data about] where these weak points are,” the Czech President noted. An amazing target: what weapons are used to repel the Ukrainian counter-offensive? The latest high-precision weapons are used in defensive battles. On this day, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukraine confirmed his words about the large losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the counter-offensive. The Russian leader at a meeting with military officers on June 13 compared the losses of Ukraine and Russia during the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. According to his calculations, “the losses of the Russian military are 10 times less than those of the Ukrainian troops.” During his speech at SPIEF-2023 on June 16, he also reported the loss of 186 tanks and 418 armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces since the beginning of the counteroffensive. In addition, Pentagon adviser Colonel On June 14, Douglas McGregor announced the complete failure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ counter-offensive. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues.

"March 2023","The Kyiv authorities, despite the statements of Vladimir Zelensky about Artemovsk (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut), began to prepare Ukrainians for the surrender of the city. New York Times columnists Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Vivek Shankar and Andrew Kramer wrote about this on March 5. “This is not a suburb - this is already Bakhmut” Russian forces continue to drive Ukrainian militants out of one of the most important cities in Donbass “Last month, Vladimir Zelensky promised that Ukraine would not give up Bakhmut, calling it “our fortress.” But in recent days, Ukrainian officials have been preparing the public for the possibility of its surrender,” the article says. As the newspaper emphasized, the Kyiv authorities admitted that “the ring is tightening around Artemovsk.” Military analyst and retired Australian Army Major General Mick Ryan, whose words the newspaper cited, noted that “the Russian army has slowly but surely begun to take positions in and around Bakhmut.” Also, experts from the Institute for the Study of War told The New York Times that “cutting off roads that represent vital supply routes for Ukrainian militants could force Kyiv troops leave their positions and retreat.” The day before, analysts from the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Russian forces were able to secure a positional advantage over units of Ukrainian troops in Artemovsk. At the same time, according to their forecasts, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are more likely to be able to retreat than to be surrounded. At the same time, Ukrainian military analyst Pyotr Chernik admitted that the Ukrainian military would soon leave Artemovsk. On March 3, the commander of the Ukrainian troops with call sign Magyar stated that the Ukrainian Armed Forces unit received an order from the command to immediately leave Artemovsk. However, military expert Vasily Dandykin pointed out that the Ukrainian military is not the most reliable source and in the current conditions disinformation is possible. Moreover, on March 1, adviser to the acting head of the Donetsk People's Republic Igor Kimakovsky reported that the most experienced units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces lost up to 70% in battles in the Artemovsk area personnel. Prior to this, on February 14, former adviser to ex-President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin expressed the opinion that Kiev’s loss of Artemovsk would lead to a wave of popular discontent in Ukraine, which, in turn, could threaten Zelensky’s overthrow. According to him, in this case, an unenviable fate awaits him, along with the head of the office, Andrei Ermak, and the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

"11 November 2023","As a result of the meeting of the foreign and defense ministers of the United States and India in New Delhi in the “2+2” format, the parties reached agreements on the development of cooperation in the defense sector on a wide range of issues. This was reported on the website of the US Department of Defense on November 10. “Developing the dynamics of bilateral relations, the four leaders agreed to continue to advance all elements of a major defense partnership,” the US Department of Defense said in a publication. It is clarified that Pentagon head Lloyd Austin discussed priorities in bilateral relations and challenging concerns about global events at a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Foreign Minister. According to the text of the message, Austin welcomed the Indian Prime Minister's views on joint steps by the two sides to consolidate the achievements of a major defense partnership and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region. Presenters US and Indian policymakers noted incredible progress in implementing the new roadmap for US-India defense industrial cooperation, written in June. Austin emphasized the two countries' intention to enter into an agreement to jointly produce armored infantry vehicles. In addition, the meeting raised issues of further integration of the defense-industrial ecosystems of the United States and India. The parties expressed support for the proposal to conduct exercises of increasing complexity and geographic scope to increase interoperability between the armed forces of the two countries. The Pentagon release reports that following the dialogue, the Western media, Blinken and Austin discussed in India the purchase of American weapons for the Indian army, in particular, the purchase of American engines for combat aircraft of the Indian Air Force. The delivery of American drones worth $3 billion was also on the agenda. New Delhi supported Washington's proposal to supply India with armored vehicles. Empty corridor: the United States and India decided to build routes to Europe According to Washington’s plan, this project should displace China’s “One Belt, One Road” Austin’s arrival in India was reported earlier, on November 9. It was noted that the visit would last two days. This is the fifth meeting of the ministers of India and the United States in the “2+2” format, and for the head of the Pentagon this is already the ninth visit to the Indo-Pacific region. Prior to this, on October 20, the American media reported the White House’s intention to request more than $100 billion from Congress, $7 billion of which will be allocated for humanitarian assistance to the Indo-Pacific region.

"September 2023","The Starlink satellite system was created for peaceful purposes, not for guiding drones. These are the words of American entrepreneur Elon Musk for a new book about his biography, quoted by CNN. “Starlink was not intended for wars. It was created so that people could watch Netflix, relax, study remotely and do good peaceful things, and not for drone strikes,” Musk commented on the use of the Internet. It is also noted that Musk secretly ordered engineers to disable Starlink near the coast of Crimea last year to avoid a Ukrainian attack on the Russian Navy. “When Ukrainian underwater drones loaded with explosives approached the Russian fleet, they lost contact and washed ashore harmlessly,” the book says. The decision to shut down was made out of fear before the possible use of nuclear weapons by Russia as a response to the Ukrainian terrorist attack. The book notes that Ukrainian officials then “begged” Musk to return the Internet. Beijing liaison: Elon Musk spoke out regarding the Taiwan crisis US financial elites have different views on the idea of escalating the conflict Starlink is a satellite network that provides Internet access from anywhere on the planet. Kyiv received over 20 thousand terminals from this company. The project was launched by the American company SpaceX in February 2018. Earlier, on August 23, the United States accused Russia of trying to disrupt the use of Starlink in Ukraine. It was noted that the so-called Russian attempts to disrupt the system were unsuccessful. On June 2, the Pentagon entered into a contract with SpaceX, owned by American businessman Elon Musk, to provide satellite communication services to Ukraine using Starlink terminals.

"10 April 2023","Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday, April 10, did not rule out that the United States spied on Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. This is how he commented to reporters on CNN’s statement that the leak of the Pentagon documents confirmed the fact that Washington was spying on the Ukrainian leader. According to the press secretary of the Russian President, the leaks of the Pentagon documents are “quite interesting,” they are being studied and widely discussed. “What the United States is for various heads of state, especially in European capitals, began surveillance long ago, this came up repeatedly, caused various scandalous situations, it’s all easy to remember. Therefore, this cannot be ruled out,” he said, answering a question from Izvestia. Two steps back: how the rhetoric about the Ukrainian crisis is changing in the United States American political elites have different views on the future of the conflict Earlier in the day, the director of the Institute of CIS Countries in Sevastopol, captain 1st rank in the reserve, Sergei Gorbachev, also commented on CNN data about the leaks of Pentagon documents . In his opinion, Zelensky is completely controlled by the United States, and the very question of spying on him is inappropriate. On April 9, CNN reported that the United States is spying on friendly countries, including Ukraine, Israel and South Korea. It was noted that Washington was collecting information about the shortcomings of Ukraine’s weapons, air defense (air defense), and the number of battalions. As the TV channel reported, this is confirmed by some genuine secret documents from the Pentagon (the headquarters of the US Department of Defense), which were leaked online earlier. According to the TV channel’s source, due to the leak of information, Ukraine changed some military plans. Prior to this, on April 7, the newspaper The New York Times reported that the scale of the Pentagon intelligence leak was about 100 documents. They were posted publicly on social networks. Later, the US Department of Justice began an investigation into this case. On April 8, an American newspaper wrote that after the incident with the leak of Pentagon documents on the situation in Ukraine, the allies’ trust in the United States was greatly shaken.

"15 December 2023","If Ukraine joins the European Union, it will become the fifth most populous country in the union and at the same time the poorest, which will lead to the need to allocate significant amounts of subsidies to it. The Washington Post (WP) reported this on Friday, December 15. “There is a growing feeling in Brussels that Ukraine’s membership will change the balance of power in the EU, affect its agricultural market and upend its budget,” the publication clarified. In addition, the potential the inclusion of Ukraine, as well as Moldova, Georgia and some other countries also on the path to joining the EU, will change the balance of power in the association, shifting it to the east. “In Brussels, many countries believe that in order for Ukraine and other countries to join, the European Union will need to reform its key institutions, including parliament,” reports WP. In addition, Ukraine’s inclusion in the EU will require a rethinking of the bloc’s common agricultural policy, since the republic, possessing huge arable land, will be able to claim billions in payments. “Despite the fact that there is a lot left before membership years, the problem of Ukrainian exports to the EU market has already caused protests: farmers in neighboring countries were outraged due to an excess of grain,” the report clarifies. At the same time, the conflict destroyed the Ukrainian economy and increased its financial needs. International organizations estimated a year after the operation began that the cost of rebuilding Ukraine was more than $400 billion. “With fighting still raging and the membership process likely to take many years, if not decades, it is difficult to estimate the financial impact of Ukraine’s membership.” , reported WP. A difficult deprivation: Ukraine will not be able to become a member of the EU in the coming years. At the same time, the decision to begin negotiations with Kiev regarding integration was made despite the position of Hungary. Earlier this day, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that without funding from the United States and the European Union, Ukraine is at risk go bankrupt by March 2024. According to forecasts from Brussels and Kyiv, in the absence of support, March 1 will become the “day of collapse” of the Ukrainian state. Also on December 15, it became known that Hungary used its veto power, rejecting the financial assistance program for Ukraine. In particular, the support plan for Kyiv included the provision of €50 billion from the EU budget until 2027. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed an application for the country to join the EU in February 2022. In April of the same year, the Ukrainian side submitted to the union the completed second part of the questionnaire for obtaining candidate status, which was agreed upon in June 2023.

"12 December 2023","Washington is not interested in restoring peace in Ukraine. This was stated by member of the House of Representatives of the American Congress Marjorie Taylor Greene on her page on the social network X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, December 11. Greene recalled that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky came to the United States to discuss receiving military assistance for Kyiv. “Because in Zelensky is in the city, and Ukraine’s money is drying up, why is no one in Washington talking about a peace treaty with Russia?” - she wrote. Greene suggested that this visit of the Ukrainian president is an opportunity to persuade him to diplomacy and convince him of the need for peaceful negotiations with Russia. However, calls for peace are still not heard. According to Green, Washington actually benefits from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which means that the United States is not interested in peace between these countries. “Isn’t this terrible?!” - she summed up. A small spool but a long one: the United States has run out of money and time for Ukraine What options does the Biden administration have to continue supporting Kyiv and what does the CIA have to do with it? Earlier on the same day, Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Andrei Klimov indicated that currently some American politicians are no longer afraid to talk about a truce. Before this, on December 10, US Senator from Ohio James David Vance said that Ukraine would be forced to cede part of the country's territories to Russia to end the conflict.

"February 2024","Republicans are furious over US President Joe Biden's Russia-friendly decision to ban the export of liquefied natural gas. The American magazine Foreign Policy wrote about this on February 4. As noted in the publication, the reaction of representatives of the party competing with Democrat Biden is intensified by the fact that, according to the new laws, they cannot block this decision, although previously the president would have had to submit it for approval. Republicans also, according to FP, drew attention to the benefits of this ban for Russia and even called it a “gift” to Russian President Vladimir Putin. US allies in Europe and Asia also did not appreciate Biden’s decision. Countries that have imported LNG from the United States need constant suppliers of fuel, and the ban by the American president undermines the credibility of the United States as an LNG exporting country and could affect the development of the economies of countries that are now going to look for new sources of energy. They have painted themselves into a corner: the EU's losses due to anti-Russian sanctions have reached $1.5 trillion. Expensive energy resources have provoked a decline in production. The Biden administration announced a temporary pause in approving decisions on LNG exports from January 26. As the American president explained, this was done because of climate change, which poses a threat. During the pause, the Biden administration will monitor the impact of the request on US energy security, the environment and energy prices. Biden's decision to suspend LNG exports could have a negative impact on the EU countries, since, as Bloomberg indicates, the EU does not plan to extend the agreement with the Russian Federation on gas transit through Ukraine.

He also noted that Zelensky returned from the United States with almost nothing, while during the period of reflection between Washington and Brussels, Kyiv was engulfed in fire from attacks by Russian troops. According to Sandbu, this means that there will be “no merry Christmas” for the Ukrainian president. Suddenly not a friend: a split in the leadership of Ukraine deprives it of the support of the West How dangerous is the popularity of the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny for Zelensky Earlier this day, columnist for the Myśl Polska publication Krzysztof Podgurski wrote that the Russian army is significantly superior in strength to the Ukrainian one and continues to develop successfully, while The Ukrainian Armed Forces have practically exhausted their resources. He added that Ukraine, against the backdrop of huge losses, has almost exhausted its mobilization resources. The day before, Zelensky’s adviser on economic issues, Oleg Ustenko, said on the air of the All-Ukrainian telethon that in the absence of Western funding in the first days of 2024, Kyiv will move to “plan B” and turn to internal borrowings. He expressed confidence that in any case, “financial support will follow,” but the main question remains the timing of its provision. Commenting on his statements, State Duma deputy from the Republic of Crimea Mikhail Sheremet suggested that the Kyiv authorities “immediately move on to Plan D” and “leave the Ukrainian people in peace.”On December 14–15, the European Union (EU) summit was held in Brussels; during the event, Hungary blocked a €50 billion aid plan for Ukraine until 2027. Another summit dedicated to this issue is planned in January. A day earlier, the leader of the Democratic majority in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, said that the Senate intends to postpone the holidays and continue working on additional budgetary allocations, including for assistance to Ukraine. At the same time, the House of Representatives is currently planning to return to work only in January. On December 10, the White House announced that the United States had $1 billion left to replenish its own arms stocks, which are depleted due to regular deliveries to Ukraine. In this regard, Congress was called upon to approve the White House's request for an additional $60 billion in aid to Ukraine. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the escalation situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

State Duma deputy Boris Gladkikh stated this on March 20. In this way, he responded to the information that the Polish Embassy in France on March 19 denied the words of its own ambassador, Jan Emerik Roscishevsky, that Warsaw was allegedly ready to become a participant in the conflict with the Russian Federation in the event that if Kyiv is defeated. “The level of professionalism of representatives of European countries at various levels of positions has changed significantly over the past decades, and the consequence is thoughtless blunders when “he said it, but in the heat of the moment did not think.” And balanced minds are trying to rewind, realizing that the story does not end today, and perhaps in the future it will be necessary to build relations with the Russian Federation, and in Ukraine alone the world has not converged like a wedge,” Duma TV quoted the deputy as saying for Izvestia. Gladkikh noted that there are people in the West who are trying to stop hotheads. The parliamentarian expressed hope that in the future such a balanced position will begin to prevail. “There are people who are trying to stop hotheads, who, quite possibly, in three to five years, it is not at all clear where they will end up, but the country will have to be developed, and we are still After all, we are on the same continent. And I hope that such a balanced position will begin to prevail in the future, especially taking into account how and what history the EU countries got involved in and what losses they faced,” he concluded. Data summary: why Vladimir Putin visited the command post of the special operation The president arrived in Rostov-on-Don after a visit to Mariupol The leader of the French Patriots party, Florian Philippot, called the statement of the Polish Ambassador to France insane. In his opinion, it demonstrates the reluctance of the North Atlantic Alliance and the European Union to achieve peace. In turn, Russian Senator Alexei Pushkov called the diplomat’s speech arrogant and noted that such a scenario is hardly possible without the support of the United States.

"28 May 2023","Military weapons and military equipment that the allies supply to Kyiv can be used against Western countries after the end of the Ukrainian conflict. The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad wrote about this on May 26. “There are serious concerns among security experts. <…> One of the main problems: what will happen to the equipment after the transfer to the Ukrainian armed forces?” — the publication writes. It is noted that after the end of the conflict, weapons may fall into the wrong hands and turn against the West. NRC also recalled that Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock said last year that after the end of the conflict, all Ukrainian weapons will go to criminals or go away on the black market, as is already known from other conflicts. Shtok expects “a large influx of illegal weapons into Europe.” Journalists cite two situations as an example. The first is the consequences of arms supplies to Afghanistan, where the Taliban (the Taliban movement, an organization under UN sanctions for terrorist activities) can continue to use Western arsenals for many years, which were transferred to the Afghan army with good intentions. The second is weapons that were used during the Balkan wars in the 1990s, and then ended up on black markets in Brazil, Iraq, and also went to rebel groups in Angola and Rwanda. “The country (Ukraine - Ed.) was known for its active illegal trade weapons. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was left with 7 million small arms, some of which were smuggled to other countries, such as Liberia and Afghanistan. Ukraine has also been a center for arms smuggling from the Balkans,” the article says. Since 2014, according to the publication, Ukraine’s reputation has worsened due to the looting of overcrowded army warehouses in the east of the country. More than several hundred thousand “small arms” (such as rifles and revolvers) and “light weapons” (such as anti-aircraft missiles and anti-tank weapons) have “disappeared from the radar.” There is no guarantee that all Western-supplied weapons will remain in Ukraine. The Netherlands is trying to enforce this guarantee through the signature of the Kyiv authorities that “military equipment may only be used by Ukrainian government authorities for defense purposes and cannot be transferred or resold to other parties without written permission.” No runway: The United States will continue consultations on the supply of F-16s to Kiev Russia called the West's plans to send fighters to Ukraine a move towards escalation. Last June, Sweden also warned about the possibility of weapons supplied to Ukraine ending up on the black market. The supplied weapons ultimately “may simply disappear on the black market” due to the fact that Ukraine does not control its territory, said Simon Wezeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). At the end of April 2023, the Russian Foreign Ministry reported that that Kyiv’s NATO allies are escalating hostilities due to constant supplies of weapons.

The National Interest stated this on May 9. “Patriot systems are vulnerable. The Patriot system's radar gives away its location, making it an easy target for Russian strikes. Patriot systems are limited to point defense of major assets and are designed to work in tandem with air defense systems that engage targets at high and low altitudes. Without these additions, Patriot will have too many threats to defeat, and the result will be weak coverage,” the article says. Additionally, it is not practical to use $3 million interceptors to destroy drones that cost significantly less.

As noted, these plans could be destroyed by the Hungarian Prime Minister, who demanded that the entire political and financial process be blocked until the leaders agree to review aid to Kiev.

According to the Prime Minister, negotiations on Ukraine’s accession to the EU should be put on the agenda only if “adequate preparations have been made and various interests have been agreed upon.” At the moment, Orban pointed out, the EU is poorly prepared for the upcoming summit on Ukraine's membership. Kyiv is in a state of conflict, so the legal system there works differently than in a peaceful country, he added.

"January 28 2024","Officials of the Ukrainian defense department were suspected of stealing 1.5 million hryvnia (almost $40 million) intended for the purchase of shells for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). This was reported by the country's Security Service (SBU) on Saturday, January 27. “According to the investigation, former and current officials of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the deal. The attackers tried to steal almost 1.5 billion budget hryvnias from the purchase of 100 thousand mortar rounds for the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” says the SBU Telegram channel. Investigative authorities established that in August 2022, officials entered into a contract for the wholesale purchase of artillery shells with an arms supplier, the company “Lviv Arsenal”, after which the Ministry of Defense transferred the amount stipulated by the agreement to the enterprise’s account, and the company’s management transferred a portion to the balance sheet of a foreign commercial structure, which was supposed to send ammunition to Ukraine. However, none of the shells under this deal ever reached Kyiv. The foreign company withdrew the funds received into the shadows, and the amount remaining in the accounts of the Ukrainian supplier ended up in one of the capital’s banks. “As a result of comprehensive measures, SBU officers documented a scheme for the theft of public funds and identified all persons involved in the transaction,” the press service notes.

It is clarified that the crime was committed during the purchase of body armor for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). Cases of corruption in Ukraine have been actively covered in the media since the beginning of the Ukrainian conflict in February 2022. Despite the statement by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in early November 2022 about the absence of fraud by officials in the country, similar situations are repeated. At the end of August 2023, it was reported that Ukrainian law enforcement officers exposed three representatives of the Ministry of Defense, who stole about $580 thousand during the purchase of military ammunition for the army In December, co-founder and executive director of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Center Daria Kalenyuk said that the country's authorities and military leadership are not able to provide the Ukrainian Armed Forces with everything they need.

Advisor to the Prime Minister Balazs Orbán stated this on February 10 in an interview with Exxpress. “When the heads of state and government of the EU spoke with Prime Minister [Viktor] Orbán on the phone, they openly told him exactly this threat,” he confirmed. The publication referred to a recent article by the Financial Times, which reported a leak of a document according to which the EU was blackmailing Hungary. Then representatives of Brussels denied the information. Balazs Orban noted that such actions by the leaders of the EU countries can be regarded as “de facto political rape.” Despite the fact that Budapest eventually agreed to provide assistance to Kyiv, the Prime Minister’s adviser noted that the funding was carried out taking into account the requirements of the Hungarian side, that is, it did not become “uncontrolled.” “We won: now there is a control mechanism. This way we will get information about what is happening with the money, and we will be able to talk about it every year,” Orban emphasized. Eternal bargaining: how Hungary opposes the European Union Viktor Orban is gaining popularity in Europe Hungary, at a meeting in Brussels on Ukraine, which took place on December 14–15, blocked the allocation of €50 billion to Kiev. In the same month, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested that the EU refrain from assistance Ukraine over the next five years, noting that the €50 billion that the union is going to transfer to Kyiv simply does not exist. On January 22, Bloomberg reported that the EU plans to adopt an aid package for Kyiv on February 1 at a summit in Brussels. If Hungary again blocks the initiative, the alliance countries will deprive it of its voting rights and make a decision without it. The Financial Times, citing an EU document, wrote on January 29 that the alliance could sabotage the economy of Budapest if it continues to prevent the allocation of aid to Kyiv. It is assumed that the levers of pressure could be the exchange rate of the Hungarian forint and the level of investment attractiveness of Hungary. On January 30, Orban told Le Point that he was ready to make a decision on financing Ukraine, common with the other 26 EU countries, if it was guaranteed that the amount would be approved every year by unanimous consent. basis. On February 10, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó said that Hungary was under heavy attack from the Euro-Atlantic community because it advocated peace negotiations on Ukraine. He explained that the country has always been confident that it is necessary to end the Ukrainian conflict as soon as possible, and the only way to do this is through negotiations. The day before, on February 9, Szijjártó said that the European Union had lost its political weight and competitiveness when it found itself under the control of the United States and began to act on their instructions. He drew attention to the fact that the alliance was unable to isolate the conflict in Ukraine and instead gave it a practical global character, making it more serious by supplying Kyiv with weapons. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which began February 24, 2022 due to the aggravation of the situation in the region as a result of Ukrainian shelling.

The commander of the US Air Force in Europe and Africa, James Hecker, announced this on August 18. He explained that Kyiv sends inexperienced pilots for piloting training. They will have to train on propeller-powered aircraft, then go to France to fly Alpha Jet jet trainers. “All this takes time... So you won't see F-16s in Ukraine until at least next year. It takes some time to build a couple of squadrons of F-16s and get them to a high enough combat readiness and high enough proficiency. I mean, it could be in four years or five years,” Breaking Defense quoted Hecker as saying. He also pointed out that the powerful Russian army is preventing the Ukrainian Armed Forces from achieving success on the battlefield. To the downed pilots: how the delivery of F-16s to Kyiv will change the battlefield And what these machines are capable of in the hands of Ukrainian pilots Earlier in the day, member of the House of Representatives, Republican Marjorie Taylor-Green said that sending American F-16 fighters to Ukraine would be a step towards world war In addition, on August 18, former American intelligence officer Scott Ritter said in a conversation with Izvestia that Ukrainian pilots will not be able to effectively use F-16 fighters. He recalled that Ukrainian pilots had never flown on NATO aircraft before, so they would not be able to use the full potential of such aircraft. At the same time, French military officer Alain Corvez told Izvestia that the supply of F-16s to Ukraine would not change the situation in the special operation zone in favor of Kyiv . Korvez noted that there is a problem in training Ukrainian pilots. In his opinion, if any of the European or American pilots decide to take part in a special operation, this will be tantamount to a declaration of war on Russia. The day before, Reuters, citing a US official, reported that Washington approved the transfer of F-16 fighters from Denmark and the Netherlands to Kiev upon completion of training of pilots of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

"23 August 2023","The head of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Energy, Grant Shapps, told Reuters that the UK plans to provide Ukraine with about $245 million for the purchase of nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants (NPPs), including from British companies. Leading expert of the National Energy Security Foundation and the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation Stanislav Mitrakhovich, commenting on this message to Izvestia on August 23, noted that Kyiv is completely dependent on the West in matters of financing the country’s economy, and energy in particular. “The UK will give this amount, others countries, including the Americans, can allocate additional money. If there is not enough, I think that I will still finance Ukraine: there will be new tranches or loans. It is clear that political support from the West still remains; it is also implemented in supporting the economy. Therefore, I don’t think that a situation will arise in which Ukraine will not be given money to purchase fuel for nuclear power plants,” the expert said. According to him, until 2022, Kiev had two main fuel suppliers: Russia and the American company Westinghouse, which had plant in Sweden, made nuclear fuel assemblies for stations of Soviet industrial design. “How will Ukraine get nuclear fuel now? Details have not been publicly disclosed, but I think the main supplier is Westinghouse. Maybe [the supplier] will be Urenco, which is partly British? Yes, I think they can also start making the fuel that Ukraine needs,” Mitrakhovich concluded. Dark affairs: why the Ukrainian energy sector will never recover In Kyiv, they announced a huge shortage of electricity. Earlier, on March 17, the press service of the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine reported that in three years the country plans to establish the production of its own nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants, which will be able to replace Russian . Then the ministry noted that Kyiv produces components of fuel assemblies of the VVER-1000 type. In the future, it is planned to launch production of assemblies for VVER-440 reactors.

"25 March 2023","Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki gave an interview in which he criticized Germany for insufficient funding for Ukraine. He also proposed three options through which assistance to the country would be most effective. The publication was published on the Politico website on Friday, March 24. The Polish leader believes that Germany, having the status of the richest country today, is not helping Ukraine enough: the state should “send more weapons, send more ammunition and give more money.” Morawiecki admitted that Berlin is one way or another taking measures to support Kyiv. For example, in addition to tranches of military aid, he lifted the ban on sending weapons to combat zones. However, according to the Prime Minister, Germany had to be begged for a positive decision on the export and re-export of German Leopard tanks. Morawiecki, who heads military aid to Ukraine among EU leaders, said that Eastern European countries, including Poland, were dissatisfied with the actions of France and Berlin to support Ukraine. Moreover, the Polish prime minister raised the issue of Berlin's contributions to the joint EU fund. According to him, the country does finance more than other allies, but its contribution is proportionate compared to its budget. These German actions also did not impress the Polish leader, as Warsaw hopes to receive compensation from the EU due to donations to Ukraine. However, at the moment, all expenses of the fund cover only the purchase of military equipment and ammunition for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). Accordingly, Berlin could allocate more money. He also expressed dissatisfaction with Germany's past energy policy, which operated on Russian gas. According to Morawiecki, the Germans did not pay attention to Poland’s warnings about the “danger of this path.” “With their rather erroneous gas and oil policy towards Russia, they are responsible for what is happening, for this mess in the energy market,” concluded he.Speaking about the methods that would most effectively affect Ukraine’s successes during the armed conflict, Morawiecki named three solutions to this issue. Among his proposals are NATO allies increasing their target spending to 3% of output, the EU exploring the issue of raising new debt for defense purposes, and partner countries accelerating efforts to use frozen Russian assets for military purposes. “Any further assistance, including tanks, will change little” Member of the European Parliament from Croatia Ivan Sincic - about the senseless supply of old equipment to Ukraine and sanctions against the Russian Federation The day before, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky himself indicated that partner countries are not achieving new successes in supporting Ukraine and delay making new decisions. He stressed that Kyiv needs immediate supplies of long-range weapons and more modern aircraft. Earlier, on February 16, Polish President Andrzej Duda and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during a joint meeting said that the support provided by Western countries to Ukraine should be intensified in the near future.

"16 June 2023","Saturation of the information field by the West with news about the Ukrainian counter-offensive is just intimidation that has no basis. Acting head of the Kherson region Vladimir Saldo announced this on Friday, June 16, on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF). “Saying and doing are two big differences. Therefore, they can talk about that counter-offensive, but they cannot do it, and, strictly speaking, there is nothing to do. I mean human resources,” he said. Saldo explained that, despite pumping Ukraine up with Western military equipment and ammunition, the country does not have enough manpower to fight with these weapons. More and more mercenaries are appearing there, who don’t care where or with whom to fight, and Ukrainians are increasingly developing an internal protest against what is happening. “Fewer and fewer Ukrainians are fighting, and more and more they are still gaining access to the truth, they they see what is happening, they already understand that they are being deceived,” summed up the acting governor. Tanks are not fast: why the West did not decide to supply Leopard to Kyiv The next package for Ukraine did not include heavy armored vehicles. Earlier that day, Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking at the SPIEF plenary session, announced heavy losses for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) during the counter-offensive, compared to the Russian army, and noted that at the time of his speech, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were trying to break through the Russian positions on the Vremevsky salient. Also, as part of his speech, Putin said that Russia had destroyed about 30% of the armored vehicles supplied to Ukraine by the West. The head of state clarified that the Russian Armed Forces destroyed 218 tanks and 418 armored vehicles. In addition, the president pointed to NATO’s increasing involvement in the conflict in Ukraine.

"March 2023","Western intelligence services knew about the presence of a Ukrainian trace in the situation with the explosions of the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines. The Times writes about this on March 8. As the authors of the article write, NATO countries did everything possible to prevent public disclosure of Ukraine’s connection with sabotage on pipelines, as this would naturally lead to a deterioration in relations between Kiev and Berlin. Material also notes that the intelligence services of Western countries know the name of the “private sponsor” of organized sabotage. According to the intelligence services, this is a wealthy Ukrainian who is personally acquainted with the country’s President Vladimir Zelensky; his identity has not been disclosed. “Sooner or later, his name will definitely be announced, especially considering that he seems to have left his unusual “business card” . Ukraine’s relations with its allies will remain in a better state if this person himself makes a confession,” the publication writes. What kind of “calling card” we are talking about is not specified in the publication. Head to head: is there a chance for an international investigation into the JV explosions? Russia calls for a collective search for answers; the opposition in Germany proposes to create a special commission. Earlier, on March 7, the American edition of The New York Times reported on the possible involvement of a pro-Ukrainian group in the attack on Nord Streams. . From the material it follows: some US officials believe that Ukraine and its allies had the most logical potential motive for attacking the pipelines. In turn, former US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter, during a conversation with Izvestia, pointed out that The United States is very concerned that inconvenient details will come to light, so with the help of an article in The New York Times they are trying to provide themselves with an escape route in case they start to blame them. US journalist Seymour Hersh called the New York Times article about the involvement of Ukrainians in attack on the joint venture. The journalist learned about the article during a conversation with Izvestia. He also told Izvestia that he would publish a new investigation about Nord Streams next week. Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov said that publications about explosions at Nord Streams are a coordinated hoax. He also expressed bewilderment at how American officials cited by the media can assume something about terrorist attacks on Nord Stream without an investigation. On February 8, Hersh published an investigation into sabotage on Russian gas pipelines. It says that divers from the United States planted bombs during the Baltops exercise in the Baltic Sea back in June last year, and the Norwegians activated the explosives. Washington’s motives, according to the journalist, were to force Germany to provide military and financial support to Ukraine. Leaks on Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 were discovered in September 2022. A representative of the Swedish seismic center, Björn Lund, said that two powerful underwater explosions were recorded in the area of pipeline leaks at the time of the emergency. Traces of explosives were found at the scene of the accident. The Russian Federation called the incident an act of state terrorism.

On December 12, it was reported that the headman of the village of Smykov in the Lviv region in western Ukraine did not allow the monument to the Soviet soldier to be demolished. Also on December 1, it became known that residents of the villages of Kinashev and Zagorye-Kukolnytskoye in the Ivano-Frankivsk region of Ukraine opposed the demolition of monuments to Soviet soldiers. Before this, on September 22, Chairman of the Russian Federation Council Valentina Matvienko called Ukraine a sad example of cultural degradation. She pointed out that ancient Orthodox shrines there are currently being desecrated, monuments to great figures of the past are being dismantled, and their own history is being deliberately distorted, and “executioners and traitors are being exalted.” On June 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that a park of monuments could be created in Russia , which are demolished by the Ukrainian authorities. In particular, the head of state announced his readiness to take away the monument to Catherine II, dismantled in Odessa. Since 2015, Ukraine has been pursuing a policy of decommunization within the framework of the law “On the Condemnation of the Communist and Nazi Regimes.” The law involves the renaming of all topographical objects whose names are in any way connected with the Soviet Union or Russia, as well as the demolition of monuments and the dismantling of memorial plaques. This policy especially escalated after the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass in February last year.

"March 2024","The German Ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, called the leaked conversation between Bundeswehr officers about the strike on the Crimean Bridge a “good lesson” and called for no apology for the security breaches that caused it. He said this on the BBC on March 6. “I think this is a good lesson for everyone: never use the Internet in a hotel if you want to make a secret call,” Berger said. Responding to criticism from the former British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace that Germany is “heavily penetrated by Russian intelligence” and is “neither safe nor calm,” the diplomat called his words “extremely unhelpful.” In addition, Berger accused Russia of publishing the call and called on the allies to focus on supplying Ukraine with sufficient amount of ammunition. “Scholz will have to remove Pistorius from office” Bundestag deputy Herold Otten - about the scandal in the Bundeswehr, the arms lobby in Germany and the conflict between the Russian Federation and NATO On March 1, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion of senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, which, according to her, took place on February 19. During the conversation, the military discussed the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine. In a fragment of an audio recording from representatives of the German Air Force, officers discussed how many such shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether such a strike would be effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force command Frank Graefe, the Bundeswehr BBC inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. Official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that the German Ambassador to In Moscow, Alexander Lambsdorff did not deny the authenticity of the recording. In turn, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the conversation a demonstration of the involvement of Western countries in the conflict in Ukraine. Peskov emphasized that the recording demonstrates the extreme situation that has developed in Germany. Moscow also hopes to get acquainted with the results of the investigation by the German authorities on this topic. The Ukrainian side is making attempts to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, as this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"23 February 2024","The resolution proposed by the faction of the ruling parties in Germany to transfer long-range weapons to Ukraine for attacks on Russia is a disgrace for Germany and the entire German people. This statement was made by the head of the German national-cultural autonomy of Crimea, Yuri Hempel, on February 23. “I believe that this decision is a shame for all of Germany and for the entire German people. It’s a pity that the ruling political elite of Germany forgot history, when the possessed Fuhrer was already trying to destroy not only peoples, but also all the borders that existed then,” he noted in an interview with TASS. In addition, Hempel believes, Berlin, succumbing to pressure from Washington , destroys Christian values and its own economy. He also called on the Germans to wake up and reassess the ruling political elite of Germany. Hempel emphasized that Germany can prosper and develop only with friendship with Russia, which, according to him, history has repeatedly shown. “I am convinced that Germany, unfortunately, has lost key economic positions that it has occupied for many years,” he concluded. The Bundestag supported the draft resolution on the supply of long-range missiles to Kyiv the day before. The ruling parties called on the German Cabinet to begin supplying long-range weapons systems to Ukraine to destroy targets in the Russian rear. “Two plus or minus four”: the essence of the 1990 agreement with Germany Why the Crimean Germans proposed to denounce the document On the same day, a member of the Bundestag from the Alternative for Germany faction, Matthias Moosdorf, addressed the initiators of the resolution on the transfer of Taurus missiles to Ukraine.

In early January, the foreign policy representative of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Norbert Röttgen, said that Ukraine needed to supply Taurus cruise missiles . He emphasized that Germany has done a lot in the field of air defense of Ukraine, but it needs much more. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the escalation situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"22 January 2024","Switzerland has lost its authority as a non-partisan international platform and cannot be considered as a mediator in resolving the Ukrainian conflict. Russian Ambassador to Switzerland Sergei Garmonin stated this on January 21 in an interview with the Sonntags Zeitung newspaper. Against the backdrop of Swiss statements about the desire to hold a “peace conference” on Ukraine, the ambassador recalled that the country “consistently supports the anti-Russian line of the collective West, has joined illegitimate sanctions, and is proactively promoting the idea of an international tribunal to convict the Russian leadership.” Also, according to Garmonin, in Bern they did not particularly try to think about the reasons that prompted Russia to launch a special operation. As the diplomat noted, in fact, Switzerland “has completely lost the authority of a non-partisan international platform.” He believes that it “can hardly be called an appropriate platform” for holding a conference on peace in Ukraine. According to the ambassador, there can be no talk of any mediation from Switzerland, since the country “has lost the status of a neutral state and cannot be considered as a mediator.” Hoped for Davos: the “Zelensky formula” is failing Ukraine’s plan does not find support among the countries of the Global South Earlier that day, Member of the European Parliament from the German Alternative for Germany party Gunnar Beck, in a conversation with Izvestia, said that the “Peace Conference” on Ukraine , which Swiss President Viola Amherd proposed to hold in 2024, will not bring any results if Russia is not invited there. On January 20, Amherd announced Switzerland’s desire to hold a “peace conference” on Ukraine this year in an interview with the newspaper Schweiz am Wochenende. At the same time, she believes that Russia is unlikely to participate in this summit and doubts the possibility of achieving great results at the meeting. On January 16, Swiss National Council member Rino Büchel said that Switzerland should invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to Bern to confirm its neutrality in Ukrainian conflict. According to him, resolving the conflict in Ukraine is unthinkable without the participation of Russia. The parliamentarian considered the negotiations in Davos regarding the Ukrainian “peace formula” absurd. Prior to this, on January 14, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said during a meeting that Western countries “must, one way or another” find a way to include Russia in the process of resolving the conflict in Ukraine. According to him, there will be no peace if Russia cannot say its word.

The Foreign Ministry clarified that the diplomat stated that it was impossible to stop the “whitewashing process” of former Nazi collaborators in Ukraine.

"October 2023","Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky was unable to obtain sufficient funding from Western allies, so he will have to compromise with the Russian Federation. Sky News writes about this on Saturday, October 7. The television channel indicates that support for Ukraine has begun to burden Western countries that are facing high inflation. The article says that Kyiv’s Western allies have now turned their attention to internal problems. “The situation is developing in such a way that it begs the question whether this is the beginning of the end for Ukraine,” notes Sky News. Delay: EU foreign ministers have not agreed on assistance to Kyiv Why the EU is going through a critical moment and how this will affect Ukraine On the eve of October 5, The Telegraph columnist Con Coughlin wrote that support for Ukraine from Western countries is weakening every day, as they they increasingly doubt its feasibility. He also clarified that in Washington there are now political disputes between Republicans and Democrats over the Biden administration’s budget and assistance to Kyiv. In addition, according to the observer, the ability of Great Britain to continue to provide support to Ukraine is also questioned. On the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that if the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine stops, it will hold out for a week. He noted that the West is also running out of ammunition. According to his calculations, the United States produces 14 thousand 155-caliber shells, and the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) spend up to 5 thousand per day. Then the Business Insider portal, citing the words of the former director of the CIA analytical department for Russia, George Beebe, wrote that Putin turned out to be right about Western countries being tired of constant military and financial assistance to Ukraine.

"April 4 2023","The task of diplomacy is to search and develop peaceful, political and diplomatic ways to resolve contradictions, including between nuclear powers. However, in the context of the situation with the supply of depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine, regardless of Moscow’s readiness for dialogue to reduce nuclear risks, Western countries continue to follow a dangerous line to contain Russia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on April 4. “And this is where the problem arises.” , which is most accurately described by the already rather hackneyed but successful expression - “it takes two to tango.” Russia has repeatedly proposed constructive initiatives. Among them is the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin, launched in December 2021, to provide Russia with legally binding security guarantees in the western direction. However, in Washington and Brussels they either ignored us or the reaction was negative. Ultimately, this led to the current crisis in Ukraine,” he said in an interview with Arguments and Facts. According to the minister, today the United States and its NATO satellites have made a risky bet on further escalation of the conflict. The collective West openly declares the task of inflicting a “strategic defeat” on Russia. While Moscow is still open to contacts, but on an equal basis and with mandatory consideration of its interests. “The main prerequisite here is the West’s rejection of an aggressive hostile course. However, they are not ready for this or a constructive dialogue with us; they are busy 24/7 searching for new ways to contain Russia. The danger of such a line is obvious. We are warning our Western colleagues about this using all available methods,” Lavrov concluded. Uranium reality: what threatens the use of radioactive shells by the Armed Forces of Ukraine When they explode, these munitions turn into dust, which cannot be collected and decontaminated. Earlier, on March 22, the Russian ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, said that the West is bringing humanity to a dangerous line, beyond which lies nuclear Armageddon. Thus, the diplomat commented on the statement of the US authorities, according to which the use of ammunition with depleted uranium is “a fairly common thing.” According to the American side, this type of shells has been used for decades and does not pose any radioactive threat. On March 21, Britain announced the supply of ammunition with depleted uranium to the Kyiv regime along with Challanger 2 battle tanks. The shells are a metal blank with a core of super strong material. Slamming into the armor at high speed, it breaks through and penetrates the vehicle, causing damage to the instruments and crew. The advantage of a depleted uranium core is the high density of the material. That same day, Vladimir Putin said that Kiev’s receipt of ammunition with depleted uranium would force Moscow to respond. According to the Russian leader, the West thus confirmed its intention to “fight until the last Ukrainian.” The next day, Sergei Lavrov called the supply of nuclear shells further steps towards escalating the conflict. The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova warned of large-scale consequences for the whole world as a result of the use of ammunition with a nuclear component.

"13 December 2023","The German federal budget for 2024 includes €8 billion in military and financial assistance to Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke about this on December 13. “We will provide support to Ukraine from the regular budget as we planned and, above all, for as long as necessary. This includes €8 billion for arms supplies, financial assistance for the Ukrainian budget and probably more than €6 billion to support Ukrainian refugees in Germany,” he said at a press conference with Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Finance Minister Christian Lindner.

On December 9, the Financial Times newspaper wrote that Ukraine is no longer of particular interest to Western countries, and the financial difficulties with which Kyiv faces at the moment are quite large. As the publication clarified, in order to cover all the necessary costs for the defense and social-financial spheres of Ukraine, the country will need $41 billion from external sources of assistance.

According to her, Scholz, Habeck and Lindner have not yet completed their intensive discussions on this topic. At the end of November, Scholz promised to continue supporting Ukraine despite difficulties with the German budget. He also recalled that after the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, Germany hosted hundreds of thousands of refugees from this country. According to him, this “was the right thing”, but it became a “huge burden” for the Germans. At the same time, according to the latest opinion poll, only 20% of German residents are satisfied with Scholz’s activities as chancellor. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the escalation situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce support for Ukraine.

Military expert, retired colonel Viktor Litovkin told Izvestia about this on August 22. Earlier that day, Ukrainian Ambassador to France Vadim Omelchenko confirmed the transfer of the first batch of SCALP missiles by Paris to Kiev. He added that deliveries will continue. “SCALP is a long-range cruise missile, flies at a range of almost 300 km, an analogue of the English Storm Shadow, an analogue of the German Taurus. So there’s nothing here to cover your head with ashes, so to speak,” Litovkin noted. According to the expert, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will use SCALP missiles from Su-24 and Su-25 aircraft. “We will shoot down these missiles if they appear over our positions, we will shoot down Ukrainian planes too. The [SCALP] missile has the advantage that it goes to the target at a height of about 30 m, skirting the terrain, so it is not easy to detect it, but we know how to do it. So, no dire consequences are expected from the fact that they received this missile,” he concluded. Finger in the sky: what will the transfer of F-16 fighters to Ukraine lead to? Kyiv may receive the first batch of aircraft before the New Year. Paris decided to transfer these missiles to Kyiv on July 11.

"25 February 2023","By blackmail and dictatorship, by planting absurd interpretations of the situation in Ukraine, Western countries disrupted the adoption of collective decisions at a meeting of finance ministers and heads of central banks of the G20 countries in India. This was stated on February 25 in a message published on the website of the Russian Foreign Ministry. “As a result, the text of the document has been fully approved, with the exception of wording on Ukraine, which passes off as assessments of the discussion at the ministerial meeting something that was not actually discussed and does not relate to the topic of it conduct, became a hostage to this aggressive line,” the department noted. The elephant beats the queen: India is successfully pursuing a multi-vector policy Delhi will continue to import Russian oil despite the Western embargo Moscow expressed regret that the work of the G20 is still being destabilized by the collective West and is being used by it in an anti-Russian way. “Our opponents are primarily the United States, the EU and the G7 “They are still not slowing down in their paranoid attempts to isolate Russia, to shift the blame onto it for the provoked problems in the field of international security and the global economy,” the message says. The Foreign Ministry added that, despite the agreement by financiers on a wide range of sought-after measures, designed to give additional impetus to the global economy and financial markets, the results of the meeting did not receive an agreed status. Only a statement was released by the Indian Ministry of Finance. “Russia and China expressed a strong protest on this matter. Many other delegations also experienced serious disappointment with such ultimatum actions of the United States and its allies, which do not stop sowing enmity and hatred,” the Russian Foreign Ministry added. The Foreign Ministry called on the West to abandon its destructive course. “We proceed from the fact that the G20 should remain economic forum, and not to intrude into the security sphere, as was unanimously confirmed at its last year’s summit on November 15-16 in Bali,” the department concluded. The meeting of finance ministers and heads of central banks of the G20 member countries was held in Bangalore (Karnataka, India ) from February 23 to 25.

But we note that there is more and more expert talk about some kind of peace process. But they do not contain the political will to take into account the goals of our country, and for us this is the main priority,” Peskov said during a briefing. “There are no significant prerequisites for negotiations now.” Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergei Vershinin on the prospects for the UN’s involvement in resolving the Ukrainian crisis This is how he commented earlier that day on the statement made by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that everything possible must be done for a ceasefire and the start of peace negotiations before Kyiv launches an offensive, since this will only lead to new victims. In turn, a member of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Dmitry Belik, told Izvestia that Orban’s view of the situation, like any other adequate assessment of what is happening, ignored by Kyiv’s Western curators and the Kyiv regime itself. The parliamentarian stressed that for Ukraine and the West, the counteroffensive is an obsession designed to justify the flow of military aid, and a matter of image. On May 31, the coordinator for strategic communications at the White House National Security Council, John Kirby, noted that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky will decide on his own whether to attend Russia at peace negotiations on Ukraine. Washington will not put pressure on its ally to resume negotiations, he emphasized.

ANSA reported this on Monday, May 15, citing a source. “Budapest allegedly demanded guarantees that the fund in the future will maintain its “global” horizon and will not be used exclusively for arming Kyiv,” the article says. The current tranche should be the eighth in a row.

He noted that the Russian side does not see the prerequisites for resuming negotiations. “The West, when it begins to launch such provocative rumors, apparently tests our readiness to agree to its terms. And they, in fact, don’t really hide the conditions: take a break for several months, no agreements other than a temporary ceasefire, and during the gained time, pump up Ukraine with new weapons in addition to what has already been supplied and which is being systematically destroyed by our armed forces,” TASS quotes him as saying. As Lavrov pointed out, in this case the West adheres to the same logic as with the Minsk agreements, the terms of which, as it turned out, Germany, France and Ukraine were not going to fulfill. Counter-offensive on Ukraine: why the West is talking about a truce with Russia Kyiv is preparing for a “difficult political season” Earlier in the day, Lavrov said that Moscow does not see any serious proposals from the West for negotiations on Ukraine. According to the minister, Western countries are “forwarding” the opportunity to start negotiations, advocating exclusively support for the “peace formula” of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. At the same time, he stated the need to take into account the interests of Russian security and realities on the ground, adding that if these conditions are met, Russia is ready to negotiate on Ukraine. On September 25, American radio host Scott Horton suggested that Ukraine would have to give up Kharkov and Odessa if it refuses peace negotiations with Russia.

He emphasized that Russia cannot stop hostilities unilaterally and watch the enemy advance. In addition, Putin said that Washington must influence Kyiv if it talks about the readiness of the Ukrainian authorities for a diplomatic settlement of the crisis. Speaking about this, he also drew attention to the legislative ban on holding any negotiations, which was personally approved by the President of Ukraine. The previous session of negotiations took place in September 2022. At a press conference following its results, Lavrov noted that Western countries are “incapable of reaching agreement” due to their selfishness and lack of motivation to establish dialogue.

This was stated by the alliance's High Representative for Foreign Policy and Security, Josep Borrell, as quoted by the Politico newspaper on March 6. “Defense is the competence of member states. The point is not to have an EU army, but to work better together with the 27 armies,” he said. At the same time, Borrell clarified that among the EU countries there was a “sense of urgency and responsibility” to intensify joint work in the field of defense In addition, the newspaper pointed out that for many years Germany, France and Hungary have called on other EU countries to create a unified army, but in recent months this topic has died down amid intense discussions on defense issues. The publication noted that, according to the German MEP Hannah Neumann, the reason for the abandonment of such ideas is the inability of the organization to produce the necessary amount of ammunition to protect the alliance and its allies. Get a spin: The West has turned Ukraine into a weapons testing site How the United States and European countries are making money by prolonging the conflict and the deaths of civilians On the eve of March 5, Borrell said that the EU defense industry does not have enough funding to produce enough weapons to help Ukraine and European needs countries According to him, it is necessary to meet demand. That day, the European Commission (EC) presented the EU defense industry strategy. It included purchasing at least 40% of defense equipment on a joint basis by 2030, increasing the share of trade in this area within the European Union to 35% of the value of the alliance's circulating market also by 2030, and ensuring at least 50% of defense purchases within the organization . The strategy also proposes to include Ukraine in it. As indicated, this implies the development of close ties with Kiev and its full participation in EU initiatives in support of the defense industry. In mid-February, the EU defense industry strategy was announced by EC head Ursula von der Leyen at the Munich Security Conference. She noted that this provides for an increase in military production by 20%. The head of the EC also added that Europeans must “outwit” Russia on the battlefield. Because of the conflict in Ukraine, European countries began to announce plans to increase the pace of their defense industry. Thus, on February 14, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Germany would increase its capacity for the production of artillery shells. He added that Germany will transfer three to four times more artillery shells to Ukraine than in 2023. In addition, on February 13, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called on NATO countries to increase their defense capabilities. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine by against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

At the same time, the adviser to the American president emphasized that the moral authority of the United States was not affected by the decision to transfer these ammunition, noting, that it is more important for Washington to continue supporting Kyiv by providing it with weapons. He also added that American leader Joe Biden is determined on this issue. Hands freed: what response will the Russian Federation give to the supply of cluster munitions to Kyiv? Sergei Shoigu stated Russia’s superiority in the effectiveness and diversity of this type of weapons. Earlier, on July 13, the Pentagon confirmed the transfer of cluster munitions to Kyiv. Prior to this, on July 7, Biden called the supply of these shells a temporary step aimed at supporting Ukraine until it was possible to increase the production of artillery shells. Later, on July 16, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed the opinion that the supply of cluster munitions to Ukraine was necessary treated like a crime. According to him, the United States made such a decision “not out of a good life,” but because they are experiencing a shortage of other ammunition. In turn, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova indicated that the transfer of cluster munitions is doomed to failure. As the diplomat noted, this decision was not supported by many countries and US representatives. According to her, the supply of shells threatens the civilian population and escalates the conflict.

This opinion was expressed by the Russian Ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, on Saturday, January 27, his words were published on the Telegram channel of the diplomatic mission. “Motivated by selfish political goals, the White House’s “creative” ideas, such as the confiscation of Russian state assets, contradict not only international law, but also common sense.” “, he said. According to Antonov, Washington has driven bilateral relations between Russia and the United States into a dead end with such measures. At the same time, the result desired by the American administration cannot be expected: all attempts to deprive Russia of sovereignty or destroy its economy are doomed to failure. “[Such measures from the White House] force sensible capitals to seriously think about abandoning the use of the dollar. Once again they confirm the urgent need for the world community to transition to multipolarity,” the ambassador concluded. Antonov also emphasized that the West’s attempts to put pressure on Russia are in vain - this is so obvious that even some representatives of the American government are forced to admit the success of the actions of the Russian government to stop the consequences of restrictions .

Prior to this, on January 2, former CIA analyst Larry Johnson said that the confiscation of Russian assets frozen in the West will only improve the position of BRICS and jeopardize the US and Europe's own assets located in Russia. In November, the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would work out retaliatory measures due to the approval in the US Congress of a project to transfer frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. Western countries tightened sanctions pressure on Russia in connection with a special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to start it was announced on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened. Soon the European Union approved a decision to freeze the assets of the Central Bank.

"March 2024","scuffle between protesting farmers and the police occurred in Warsaw, the Polish TV channel Polsat reported on March 6. “During the protest in front of the office, a serious incident occurred - the protesters set fire to a “coffin” there, symbolizing the death of a farmer,” the report said. One of the protest participants tried to throw burning “props” through the barrier, behind which stood the police. As a result, a brawl broke out. In addition, as can be seen in the footage, during the action, Polish farmers burned the flag of the European Union. According to the organizers of the protests, up to 150 thousand farmers could gather for the action. Also, a huge number of pieces of agricultural machinery have accumulated at the entrances to Warsaw, making traffic difficult. The border is locked: Poland has threatened to stop the transit of goods from Ukraine. According to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, such a measure will be painful for both countries. Farmer protests have been taking place in Poland for many weeks. They demand that the government introduce an embargo on the supply of agricultural products to Ukraine and the state’s withdrawal from the European Union’s Green Deal program, which concerns the achievement of carbon neutrality in the alliance countries by 2050. In addition, Polish farmers systematically block roads in the country and entrances to checkpoints on border with Ukraine. On March 1, they blocked local highway No. 15 and demanded a meeting with the country's Prime Minister Donald Tusk. On February 27, at six checkpoints on the common border of the two states, they counted 2.1 thousand stuck heavy trucks that could not leave due to the blockages Checkpoint. Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine Alexander Kubrakov said that on February 25, unknown persons poured approximately 160 tons of Ukrainian grain from sealed wagons, which were being transported to the port of Gdansk. He called the incident “impunity and irresponsibility,” recalling that this is the fourth such case.

"13 February 2024","US Permanent Representative to NATO Julianne Smith said she does not expect Ukraine to be invited to the alliance at the summit in Washington in July. This is what she said on February 13 during a video conference with journalists, her words are reported by Reuters. “As for the summit this summer, I do not expect the alliance to issue an invitation at this stage,” Smith said. NATO still has to wait: Ukraine is again no closer to joining the alliance What was promised to Kyiv in Brussels this time and what are the moods among the member countries of the bloc Various representatives of Western countries agree that in the near future Ukraine will not be able to join NATO. Former German Ambassador to the USA and Great Britain Wolfgang Ischinger on January 17 shared his opinion that the majority in the alliance may agree to Ukraine’s accession, but there will certainly be one or three members who will block its entry. Bundestag deputy Sarah Wagenknecht on January 14 suggested that Ukraine sacrifice NATO membership for the sake of peace negotiations with Russia. In addition, she considered that the supply of Western weapons to Kyiv weakened its position in possible negotiations with Moscow. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Economic Relations of Hungary, Peter Szijjártó, on November 29, 2023, after a meeting of the alliance member countries, made a conclusion similar to the opinion of Julianne Smith that at the summit Ukraine will not receive an invitation to join NATO in 2024. Szijjártó also feared the outbreak of a third world war due to Kyiv’s entry into the alliance. On September 30, 2022, Ukraine submitted an application to join NATO on an accelerated basis. Then the country's President Vladimir Zelensky said that in fact the country was already in the alliance and met its standards.

"March 2023","The West is going to resolve the situation in Ukraine through negotiations, while the United States and its allies do not rule out the possibility of dividing the country into two parts. National Review columnist Noah Rothman writes about this. According to the columnist, the West's enthusiasm for resolving the Ukrainian issue has already begun to decline and will continue to decline. As a result, the Ukrainian authorities will be faced with a fait accompli - they will be offered a scenario for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. It is noted that under this scenario, Ukraine will literally be divided into two parts “with the approval of its so-called supporters.” One for all: Russia accepted the new territories of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions became part of the Russian Federation. Rotman also added that by that time the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will be too exhausted and weak, and therefore will not be able to resist Russian troops. Because of this, they will not be able to reach the borders of Ukraine in 1991. In addition, the journalist calculated that the United States and the European Union will have to pay too high a price for organizing a counteroffensive in Donbass and seizing Crimea. Such large-scale operations will require a colossal amount of equipment and ammunition. In addition, such battles are unlikely to be possible without air support. In addition, money will also be needed to pay for intelligence data from foreign intelligence services, the observer claims. He also notes that Russia does not intend to leave its new territories, so the scenario of the division of Ukraine following peace negotiations in such a situation looks the most realistic. At the same time, Rothman is confident that France, Germany and the United States are ready to come to terms with the fact that there will be a “destabilized” state in the person of Ukraine on NATO’s borders. It will be more difficult for Poland and the Baltic states to make this decision. Earlier that day, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that decisions on the conditions of peace in Ukraine will remain with the Ukrainians, this also applies to territorial concessions to Kyiv. This is how Scholz answered the question about whether it is possible to negotiate a settlement of the conflict on the terms of Ukraine’s renunciation of claims in the territory of Donbass and Crimea. Earlier, in October 2022, former US Ambassador to the USSR Jack Matlock said that Ukraine should renounce claims to territories annexed to the Russian Federation and agree to negotiations. He expressed the opinion that even with NATO support, Ukraine will not be able to create a stable, functioning state within the 1991 borders. Attempts to return the territories by force will lead to further escalation of the conflict. On September 30, following the results of the referendums, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed agreements on the inclusion of the DPR and LPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions into the Russian Federation. Crimea became part of the Russian Federation in 2014 following a referendum.

On November 8, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Ukrainian Armed Forces would continue counter-offensive this year and next, despite the difficult situation on the front line. He connected this with the fact that Kyiv received fewer weapons from the West than it expected.

Prime Minister of Hungary [Viktor] Orban and Prime Minister of Slovakia [Robert] Fico are very strict about the sanctions, and Austria, although it joined all previous packages, has long been expressing its dissatisfaction, because cooperation with Russia, especially in the field of energy, was for the benefit of this country, and its economy was supported by a stable supply of inexpensive Russian fuel. More and more sanctions are worsening the situation in the Austrian economy. I think this is just the beginning of the discord that is going on in these countries.

Responding to criticism from the former British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace that Germany is “heavily penetrated by Russian intelligence” and is “neither safe nor calm,” the diplomat called his words “extremely unhelpful.” In addition, Berger accused Russia of publishing the call and called on the allies to focus on supplying Ukraine with sufficient amount of ammunition. “Scholz will have to remove Pistorius from office” Bundestag deputy Herold Otten - about the scandal in the Bundeswehr, the arms lobby in Germany and the conflict between the Russian Federation and NATO On March 1, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion of senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, which, according to her, took place on February 19.

The DPA agency, citing a representative of the German Ministry of Defense, reported that on the fact of the possible interception of messages from the Air Force (Air Force) Germany has initiated a check regarding the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine for attacks on the Crimean Bridge. In turn, Bild wrote that the audio recording is most likely not fake. The Bild newspaper also reported that in the German segment of the social network X (formerly Twitter) they began to block accounts that were distributing a recording of a conversation between German officers discussing the Taurus missile strike on the Crimean Bridge. Against this background, official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova indicated that the blocking is real “covering their tracks.” Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce aid to Ukraine.

"15 November 2023","The United States continues to increase the volume of military aid to Israel, despite official calls to the state leadership to avoid civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip. Bloomberg reported this on November 15, citing Pentagon documents. As noted, deliveries at Israel’s October request to the American defense department have already begun. Thus, the Jewish state has already received 36 thousand 30-mm ammunition and about 2 thousand Hellfire missiles for AH-64E Apache helicopters, 1.8 thousand M141 grenade launchers and at least 3.5 thousand night vision devices.

"30 September 2023","Assistant to the US President for National Security Jake Sullivan said on September 29 that Washington takes into account the risk of escalation with Moscow due to support for Ukraine, but does not consider it necessary to stop providing military assistance to Kiev because of this. He noted that the issue of the risk of increased escalation between the United States and Russia keeps him awake at night. According to him, this issue is very serious, in which “the stakes are high.” “The debate in Washington (regarding this - Ed.) comes down mainly to two opposing extremes,” Sullivan said in an interview with The Atlantic. As Sullivan noted , proponents of one point of view consider it cowardly to question Russia's escalation or use of nuclear weapons, and the other extreme is that ""nothing should be done to help Ukraine, because this automatically means that there will be a third world war."" In his opinion, the answer lies in the middle between these two positions. “We need to reflect and take into account possible escalation. On the other hand, we should not be paralyzed by this. And we were not paralyzed by this, given the huge volumes of modern weapons we sent to Ukraine,” said the aide to the American president. Sullivan said that Washington is weighing the consequences of supporting Ukraine, its nature, volume, scale and technical difficulties.

"11 June 2023","The consequences of the terrorist attack at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric station could negatively affect food prices in the UK. The British newspaper The Telegraph wrote about this on Saturday, June 10. According to the chief economist of the British Institute of Food Distribution (IGD), James Walton, the breakthrough of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station affected about 500 thousand hectares of agricultural land, most of which will be taken out of circulation. Thus UK shoppers will therefore feel the pinch of rising food costs as a global decline in wheat supplies pushes up prices across all food products, the newspaper warns. “We are likely to see global markets look to alternative sources of [grain] supply. This may well push back the timeline for a return to more normal food prices,” Walton said. The sabotage of what happened: what will be the consequences of the break of the Kakhovskaya HPP dam? A state of emergency has been declared in the region, but nothing threatens the water supply of Crimea. Earlier on this day, June 11, it became known that in the Kherson region, due to the break of the Kakhovskaya HPP, more than 23 thousand residential buildings in 20 settlements were flooded. Also on this day, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations reported that 1,736 people in the Kherson region were rescued from a flood zone after a dam break at the Kakhovskaya HPP. The dam at the Kakhovskaya HPP broke through on the night of June 6. This led to uncontrolled water discharge. As a result, dozens of settlements, including Kherson and Novaya Kakhovka, were almost completely flooded. The station practically went under water. The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Russian Federation opened a criminal case for a terrorist attack following the destruction of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station dam and flooding of the territories. Chairman of the RF Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin said that he would personally supervise the investigation of the case.

"December 19 2023","Europe is beginning to understand and recognize that victory will be Russia's. Vladimir Dzhabarov, First Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, shared this opinion with Izvestia on December 19. The day before, Czech President Petr Pavel announced the possibility of significant changes in the conflict in Ukraine. Pavel pointed out that Russian President Vladimir Putin insists on his vision of the world, in which Russia has a place among the strongest powers, and other countries need to come to terms with this fact. As Dzhabarov noted, the military first of all understands that Ukraine cannot defeat Russia, and Pavel is a military man in the past. “Since Pavel is a military man in the past, a general, I think he perfectly understands that the forces of Ukraine, including the gigantic assistance that Ukraine received from the West, did not help it resist the Russian army, so the counter-offensive choked. And now, at best, they hope that the Ukrainians will switch to active defense and will be able to remain in the positions they are in,” the senator said. According to him, many European countries are beginning to “sober up,” realizing that refusal to cooperate with Moscow and parallel assistance to Kyiv puts them in a worse position. “The process of sobering up in Europe will increase, because everyone understands perfectly well that American support is dwindling. Many countries in Europe have either already entered a recession or are on the verge of a recession: they are not able to take on such a burden. And most importantly, Ukraine’s human resource is gradually being exhausted. Therefore, I think that they are talking about what is really happening,” Dzhabarov said. He added that if the West had accepted Russia’s demands for security guarantees at the end of 2021, the situation would have been different. “But they pointedly ignored , moreover, they even spoke insultingly towards Russia. Well, get what you deserve,” the politician concluded. Who's in the EU, who's on fire: the decision on Ukraine is leading Europe to a split The European Commission has begun preparing further steps to open negotiations with Kiev on membership. On December 15, it became known that Hungary used the right of veto, rejecting the financial assistance program for Ukraine. The support plan for Kyiv included the provision of €50 billion from the EU budget until 2027. 26 EU member countries voted for the allocation of this amount. Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban said that allocating money to Kyiv from the EU budget does not meet the interests of Budapest, since in this case it will be necessary to give up part of the funds owed to Hungary.

"November 2023","In the near future, many European politicians will break away from US control and begin to oppose support for Ukraine. This opinion was shared with Izvestia on November 8 by the first deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on CIS Affairs, Eurasian Integration and Relations with Compatriots, Viktor Vodolatsky. Earlier that day, the Slovak government did not approve the proposal of the previous cabinet of ministers, which ordered the sending of another package of military assistance to Ukraine for € 40.3 million. “In recent days there has been such, one might say, wave of sanity among our neighbors: first [the new Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert] Fico said that it is no longer possible to support the situation of the Nazis in Ukraine, then [the Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor] Orban harshly declares that it is necessary to negotiate with Russia, but today a member of the Czech Parliament [Radovan Vich] said that Ukraine will never win against Russia,” Vodolatsky said. According to the parliamentarian, the more European countries follow this example, the faster the cleansing from nationalism will take place.” “I think that in the near future we will hear many more very interesting proposals from European politicians that will begin to escape the control of the United States and the Anglo-Saxons,” he concluded. “Slovakia will follow the same path as Hungary under Orban” Experts gave a forecast about the policy of the country’s new cabinet towards Russia and the EU At the end of October, Fico, after the speech of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky at a meeting of the European Council, noted that the speech of the Ukrainian leader was welcomed by the participants without much interest.

Before this, Fico said at a meeting with deputies that the country would not provide military assistance Ukraine. He noted that he favors a cessation of hostilities. The Prime Minister of Slovakia emphasized that he does not care according to which peace plan they end.

"19 April 2023","The Kiev regime has built an authoritarian system in the country, hiding behind the introduction of martial law. This was stated on April 19 in the report of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the human rights situation in Ukraine. According to the department, such a system includes absolute usurpation of power, extrajudicial killings, strict censorship, the virtual liquidation of independent media and the destruction of the political opposition. Foreign Ministry specialists believe that total state propaganda has reigned in Ukraine. According to diplomats, they are looking for traitors in the country, as well as fictitious Russian spies and saboteurs. “The state of affairs with the promotion and protection of human rights in Ukraine over the past year and a half has noticeably degraded, and the trends visible in this area inspire the most serious concerns,” the report notes. report. Diplomats accuse the regime, which came to power in Ukraine in 2014, of systemically suppressing human rights, opposition and dissent in Ukraine. According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the authorities in Ukraine consider it their goal to fight everything connected with Russia. “This is confirmed by the many recorded cases of serious violations of human rights in all spheres of public life, as well as the reluctance to do anything to correct this on the part of those who calls themselves the leadership of the country,” Russian diplomats argue for their position. According to the diplomatic department, the current government in Ukraine has essentially degenerated into a neo-Nazi dictatorship. The Foreign Ministry considers the ideology and practices of Ukrainian national radicals, which the Kiev regime has armed itself with, to be proof of this assertion. Russian diplomats call Kyiv’s campaign against the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) a new level of cynicism and hypocrisy. According to diplomats, the persecution of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) took the form of a total ban and provoked a wave of seizures of churches. The department’s report notes that the situation with freedom of the media and freedom of speech in general in Ukraine also remains alarming in Ukraine. According to diplomats, the authorities are openly interfering in the work of the press. “In addition to direct influence on the media that take an independent position on the most sensitive issues, with the actual connivance of the authorities, attacks by nationalists on the offices of such media resources occur,” the department’s report says. “The ideology of Nazism once again creates threats to the security of our country.” Putin explained how the Russian Federation can respond to the actions of the West and what the main task of the Russians is now.

As a rule, this happened due to events that planned to involve participants from Russia or contained materials critical of the Kyiv authorities. “Almost the only area in which the Kyiv authorities show initiative is the glorification of Nazism and the distortion of history. Kyiv’s efforts to aggressively promote neo-Nazism, rewrite the history of the Great Patriotic War and World War II, and cultivate neo-Nazi ideologies and openly racist views are notable for their consistency. Everywhere in Ukraine, the Nazis and their accomplices of the Second World War are being whitewashed, the formation of Ukrainian collaborators who collaborated with the Nazi invaders during the war are glorified under the guise of participants in the “national liberation movement,” Russian diplomats emphasize. Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Nikolai Patrushev in Nalchik During a meeting on security issues in the North Caucasus on April 13, he stated that the security of Russia and the return of stability to Europe can only be ensured by victory over Ukrainian Nazism. He accused the United States and its allies of aiding the emergence of a neo-Nazi, terrorist state in the center of Europe. Later, on March 16, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said that Ukrainian neo-Nazis and their Western patrons will inevitably face a fair verdict, this is the course of history.

Well, help: American assistance to Ukraine will be revised. The form of support and its content will change, and the amounts will become smaller. Earlier that day, the head of the press service of the American State Department, Matthew Miller, said at a regular briefing that the United States will exhaust funds to support Ukraine in the coming weeks. Miller also emphasized that the American administration has already used more than 97% of the funds allocated to finance the Kyiv regime. At the same time, the head of the office of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Andriy Ermak, said that without approval of assistance to the country in the US Congress, there is a “great risk” of losing the conflict . He noted that if the United States decides to postpone the transfer of the next amount of money, then Ukraine’s situation in the conflict will not change.

The data relates to the end of February and the beginning of March. At the time, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned that the rate at which Ukraine was using up ammunition was “many times higher” than the rate at which its partners could replenish Kiev’s stockpiles. Air defense capabilities are critical to protecting critical facilities and equipment, the publication said. According to one of the documents, “Ukraine’s ability to provide medium-range air defense to protect the [front line] will be completely reduced by May 23.” The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense estimates that the country will be able to withstand no more than 2-3 waves of missile or drone attacks. Western countries called on Kyiv not to waste this resource on “lesser threats like drones.” Loss of faces: why the UFU are not retreating from Avdievka Ukrainian formations are ready to hold on to the territory of the DPR, not paying attention to the number of deaths. The day before, retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis noted that Kyiv would face defeat even if the counteroffensive was successful. He recalled that Ukraine has already lost most of the trained and equipped army created before February 2022 with the support of NATO. According to Davis, Kyiv has almost exhausted all its mobilization reserves, and with the start of the offensive it will lose even more trained and experienced military personnel. Ukraine cannot compete with Russia in terms of the number of weapons and ammunition, even if the West supplies Kyiv with weapons, he concluded.

"December 2023","Slovakia cannot imagine Ukraine’s membership in the European Union (EU); if this is possible, it will not happen very soon. The country's Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, Juraj Blanar, announced this on December 4 in an interview with standard.sk. “Personally, I think that Ukraine’s membership in the EU is terribly far away. We refuse to approach this politically, and the only thing we support is that Ukraine should have a prospect in the future, but in compliance with all the rules, like all other countries,” Blanar noted. The head of the Slovak Foreign Ministry noted, that he cannot imagine Ukraine's membership in the EU in the current circumstances. He noted that he would be interested to hear how, for example, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, would justify the proposal for the country's membership in the union or the opening of negotiations on EU membership for Ukraine, which is involved in an armed conflict. He noted that Slovakia is conceding the decision about Ukraine's accession to the EU to other countries and is ready to support it, but only if the country fulfills all the criteria for joining the union without exceptions. NATO still has to wait: Ukraine is again no closer to joining the alliance What was promised to Kyiv in Brussels this time and what are the sentiments among the bloc’s member countries Earlier, on November 30, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico indicated that the EU and US strategy regarding Ukraine does not work. He pointed out that Slovakia should prepare for the period after the end of the conflict in Ukraine, as well as the “standardization of Slovak-Russian relations.” Other countries also opposed Ukraine’s accession to the EU. In particular, Petra Steger, a member of the National Council of Austria from the opposition Freedom Party of Austria (APS), criticized the country’s admission to the commonwealth on December 4. She believes that Kyiv completely does not meet the Copenhagen criteria necessary to join the association due to the extremely low economic level, rampant corruption and the wrong path of Ukraine from a democratic point of view. Prior to this, on November 29, Ursula von der Leyen said that Kyiv had fulfilled almost all the requirements established by the European Union to begin negotiations on accession to the union. For Ukraine, they consist of continuing the fight against corruption, as well as introducing reforms to protect the rights of national minorities. At the same time, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said that at this stage there is no agreement among the EU member states on the issue of Ukraine's membership. The EC recommended starting the negotiation process with Ukraine and Moldova in early November. Then von der Leyen said that the actual timing of Ukraine’s accession to the EU depends on the reforms carried out in the country and the principle of “merit membership.” She noted that negotiations could start immediately after the European Council makes a formal decision on their start. President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky signed an application for the country to join the EU in February 2022. In April of the same year, the Ukrainian side submitted to the union the completed second part of the questionnaire for obtaining candidate status.

"22 January 2024","The confiscation of Russian assets by the West and the transfer of part of them to Ukraine would be an “elegant measure.” This was stated by the former head of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, in an interview with the Financial Times on January 22. “The friends of Ukraine need to send a signal that Moscow will not be able to hold out longer than Kyiv. Seizing Russian assets is an elegant measure,” Zoellick said. Also, according to the former head of the World Bank, the position of Western countries is strange, since they are not worried about the consequences of arms supplies. Zoellick expressed the opinion that Russia’s opponents exaggerate the risks and underestimate the potential benefits. According to him, the joint work of the G7 countries and the European Union is quite capable of leading to the fact that there will be no alternatives to Western money storage facilities in the world. Eurosuffering: confiscation of Russian assets will hit the European Union Will countermeasures be taken by the Russian Federation Earlier, on January 18, Reuters reported that the confiscation of Russian property carries financial risks for Western countries and is not a panacea for Ukraine. The agency also pointed to the concerns of some senior Western officials that the confiscation of Russian assets invested in government bonds denominated in euros, US dollars and British pounds could undermine the willingness of central banks to hold each other's reserves. At the same time, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergei Ryabkov said that Russia would take measures, including mirror ones, if the West confiscates frozen Russian assets. On January 16, Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Vincent van Peteghem said that the EU had begun “technical work” on the transfer of Russian assets to Ukraine. He noted Belgium's strong intention to move quickly on this issue. Bloomberg warned on January 15 that the possible confiscation of Russian assets frozen in the West could cause not only a backlash, but also fragmentation of financial markets. According to the forecast, in this case, Europe will bear the brunt of the consequences. At the end of December last year, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov indicated that if the West confiscates Russian frozen funds, the Russian Federation will take symmetrical retaliatory measures. He noted that the country has enough frozen European assets in C accounts, including dividend obligations to counterparties from unfriendly countries.

"14 March 2023","The United States has less and less ability to support the dying Kiev regime, said former Pentagon adviser Colonel Douglas McGregor in an article for The American Conservative dated March 14. In his opinion, Washington’s participation in the conflict with Russia on the territory of Ukraine only undermines both the political and economic situation in the States itself. “The realization that American and European military-industrial capacity cannot meet Ukraine's needs for ammunition and equipment is an ominous signal that should be sent during a proxy conflict that, as Washington insists, is winning its Ukrainian surrogate “,” McGregor pointed out. He emphasized that the Russian Federation is better prepared to conduct a special operation to protect Donbass than the Western bloc of allies of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, having secured not only an effective economic system, but also the political influence of the Global South. “The fact that Western economic sanctions have damaged the economies of the United States and Europe, turning the Russian ruble into one of the strongest currencies of the international system, and have hardly strengthened Washington’s global position,” the ex-colonel believes. He also expressed confidence that in the current administration of US President Joe Biden turned out to have too many representatives of the administration of former leader of the country George W. Bush, demanding that the White House leadership take more thoughtless actions in Ukraine, thereby causing a crisis of citizens’ confidence in their own authorities.

According to him, the United States underestimated Russia, and the army that the United States armed in Ukraine has been destroyed and is losing thousands of people a day. However, in January, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia’s victory in the conflict in Ukraine is inevitable. He noted that this is possible thanks to the unity and cohesion of the Russian people, as well as the work of the military-industrial complex.

State Duma deputy Dmitry Novikov said this on Wednesday, April 26. He recalled that China has repeatedly spoken out on Ukrainian issues. “He always considered the main source of the problem to be those who were not ready to provide Russia with security guarantees. Beijing also stated that if Washington’s positions had been more sound, many problems, including the Ukrainian crisis, could have been avoided,” Novikov said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. In addition, China put forward its plan for resolving the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which turned out to be much broader than just a declaration on the need to stop hostilities, the parliamentarian added. Novikov noted that if Beijing is in favor of resolving the situation, then it should be open to dialogue with all parties to the conflict, so Xi Jinping’s conversation with Vladimir Zelensky after negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin is quite logical. Frontline experience: Vladimir Putin visited headquarters in the special operation zone The visit of the head of state strengthened the positions of the commanders of Russian troops, experts are sure. Earlier in the day, Xi said during a telephone conversation with Zelensky that China would send a representative to Ukraine and other countries for consultations on a political settlement crisis, reports the 360 TV channel.

On April 26, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Moscow notes Beijing’s readiness to make efforts to establish the negotiation process on the conflict in Ukraine. At the same time, she emphasized that Kyiv demonstrates rejection of any sensible initiatives aimed at a political and diplomatic resolution of the crisis, and puts forward ultimatums with obviously unrealistic demands.

At the same time, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council ( NSDC) of Ukraine Alexey Danilov noted on November 20 that some Western countries began to call on Kyiv for dialogue with Moscow. In his opinion, this is happening because some of Ukraine's allies are afraid of Russia.

The day before, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova in a commentary in connection with The 10th anniversary of the events in the central square of Kyiv indicated that Ukraine, after the Euromaidan, had ceased to be independent.

However, the French president's message also ran counter to the intentions of the German Chancellor's office. Therefore, Scholz immediately refuted Macron’s position as soon as it hit the media headlines. “Macron’s position is weakened by the limited amount of military assistance that France has so far provided to Ukraine, which does not correspond to its status as the strongest military power in Europe,” says a Paris-based researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies research by Rym Momtaz. Moreover, Berlin did not appreciate Macron’s “joke” that some allies offered Ukraine only “helmets and sleeping bags” on the eve of the war, which became a hint towards Germany. This caused dissatisfaction with the chancellor, since Germany is confident that it spent much more on helping Ukraine than France. With fear and doubts: the West is not sure about the future of Ukraine The French President hinted at the fatigue of the United States and the EU from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict Earlier, on February 29, political scientist Alexander Asafov told Izvestia that there is and never has been unity in the countries of the European Union on the issue of Ukraine, what politicians are trying to demonstrate is artificial history. The day before, Politico wrote that disagreements between Scholz and Macron over military assistance to Kyiv are developing into open hostility. German officials are angry that while Macron is willing to talk decisively about Ukraine, he is not taking enough action compared to what Scholz is doing. On February 26, Macron announced the possibility of sending his troops to Ukraine. His statement was not supported not only in France. The possibility of sending soldiers from Western countries was denied in the USA, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, Great Britain, Germany, Lithuania and Canada. Thus, Hebestreit noted to reporters at a briefing that Scholz was skeptical about the idea of the French President. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation worsened in region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce support for Ukraine.

"July 29 2023","The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are suffering heavy losses due to Russian mines. This was stated by current German Brigadier General Christian Freuding on July 29. “Sometimes demining specialists have to crawl through minefields on their stomachs and neutralize one mine after another, performing life-threatening work manually,” the military portal T-online reports the words. Freuding noted that sappers are often fired upon. According to the US State Department, the mined area in Ukraine is equal to approximately half the area of the entire Germany. According to Freding, due to the mine clearance process, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are moving through this territory with heavy losses, and the movement itself has become almost impossible for them. At the same time, it has become almost impossible to comply with the NATO principle for handling mines - dodging or bypassing them. “All attempts at a counteroffensive have been stopped” Vladimir Putin called the losses of the Ukrainian army Earlier, on July 29, a serviceman with the call sign Buka from the 2nd Infantry Battalion named after Dmitry Donskoy said that an attempt to attack by Ukrainian Armed Forces infantrymen in the Ugledar direction in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) failed because that they were blown up by their own mines. He noted that Ukrainian troops are trying to attack Russian positions, but to no avail. On July 27, Newsweek, citing Western experts, reported that NATO countries were responsible for the failure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ counteroffensive. The magazine writes that the alliance moved up the timing of the offensive and for this reason did not have time to prepare the Ukrainian military. Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 23 announced the failure of the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian troops. The Russian leader also noted that Russian forces destroyed a record amount of Western equipment and killed thousands of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"27 December 2023","Japan's approval of the transfer of Patriot missiles to the United States would have negative consequences for Tokyo-Moscow relations, as well as for global and regional security. This was stated by official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova at a briefing on December 27. The diplomat did not rule out that during the transfer of Patriot ammunition to the United States, a scheme will be used in which they will ultimately end up in Ukraine. “In this regard, we would like to warn that in If Japanese missiles fall into the hands of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Ukrainian Armed Forces. - Ed.), such actions will be considered as clearly hostile towards Russia and will entail the most serious consequences for Japan in the context of bilateral relations,” Zakharova emphasized. She also said that Japan is so In this way, it will not only overstep its own principles, but also lose control over arms. According to her, Tokyo is once again demonstrating its course towards “consistent dismantling of the pacifist provisions of the country’s post-war Constitution.” Three in Busan, not counting the United States: what Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul discussed and why they had to wait four years for this meeting. Earlier, on December 22, it was reported that Japan, as part of simplifying the rules for the export of defense equipment, allowed the transfer of missiles for Patriot systems to the United States. Previously, Tokyo could only supply defense equipment components manufactured under their license to Washington. However, it was specified that the US government would have to obtain the consent of the Japanese side if it decided to transfer Patriot missiles produced in Japan to other countries. December 19 The Washington Post reported that the United States, by exporting shells for Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems from Japan, will be able to supply Ukraine with more air defense equipment. At the same time, it was not specified how many interceptor missiles Tokyo will transfer to Washington.

"23 April 2023","Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky faces problems if the counteroffensive fails. Ex-adviser to President Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin said this on Saturday, April 22. “In connection with the escalation of a very difficult political, economic, financial, social and religious situation in Ukraine, the last thing that keeps the population from an internal explosion is hope for offensive,” he said in a video of his YouTube channel. Soskin also noted that, judging by the sources, Ukraine does not even have the ability to carry out a counter-offensive - Western supplies are not enough to confront the Russian Armed Forces. “There is not even a smell of a Ukrainian offensive. Ukraine is without artillery, without shells, without weapons,” the ex-adviser emphasized. Raise supplies: will Kyiv receive weapons for a counteroffensive? In Germany, the 11th meeting of the contact group on Ukraine was held at the American Ramstein base. On April 22, the Foreign Policy newspaper, citing Ukrainian MP Alexandra Ustinova, reported that Ukraine postponed its counteroffensive due to the lack of necessary weapons. On April 16, The Washington Post wrote: US officials acknowledge the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have enough ammunition for a successful counter-offensive. The counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) is impossible without additional supplies of artillery and tanks from Western countries, the material noted. The American newspaper Politico reported on the proposed offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which should begin in May, on March 15. It was noted that Ukraine is considering two offensive scenarios. Moscow has repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Ukraine. Thus, on January 16, Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov stated that a new round of supplies of more advanced military equipment to Ukraine could “only delay the whole story.” The West has strengthened military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022 amid the worsening situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

"January 1 2024","The Maidan with the aim of bringing the current Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), Valery Zaluzhny, to power can be carried out in three days. This was stated by the director of the Ukrainian Institute of Policy Analysis and Management Ruslan Bortnik in an interview with the YouTube channel “Yes it is.” “Maidan in Ukraine is easy to carry out. <…> Rapid mass protests, change of power. Maximum three days,” he said. Bortnik explained that his analytical center modeled Zaluzhny’s coming to power without presidential elections: a coalition supporting the commander-in-chief will be formed in the Verkhovna Rada, which will formally remove Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky from office. Then, the expert suggested, the head of the Rada will take on the role of president, and Zaluzhny will become prime minister. “In reality, power is in the hands of the prime minister, because the coalition and the head of parliament are controlled by him. “He is the real president,” the political scientist predicted. “Bug” of discord: what will the new conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny lead to? The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine accused the president of failing to mobilize. Earlier, on December 29, the head of the French Patriots party, Florian Philippot, expressed the opinion that Zaluzhny had started an open war against Zelensky. As Filippo said, during a press conference in Kyiv, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine openly spoke out against the Ukrainian leader, characterizing the counteroffensive as a complete failure. Earlier that day, Zaluzhny’s first speech at a briefing since the beginning of the special operation was assessed by military experts. Thus, Associate Professor of the Russian University of Economics. G.V. Plekhanov, Colonel Alexander Perendzhiev said that Zaluzhny did not embellish the situation, since he understands that the end is coming.

Plekhanov, military expert Andrei Koshkin suggested that Zelensky wants to blame Zaluzhny for the failure of the counteroffensive. On the same day, Zaluzhny denied Zelensky’s words about the number of those being mobilized in the country. The head of state said that the General Staff and the Commander-in-Chief suggested that he mobilize 450-500 thousand people. Commenting on these words, Zaluzhny said on the Rada TV channel that the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not make a request for the mobilization of citizens indicating the specific number of people who want to be called up for military service. Before this, on December 18, a former special forces officer, retired colonel Anatoly Matviychuk said that Zaluzhny could try to overthrow Zelensky.

"March 2024","The German Ambassador to Moscow Alexander Lambsdorff did not deny the authenticity of the recording of German officers about the attack on the Crimean Bridge. This was stated by official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova on March 6. “When the German ambassador arrived on Smolenskaya Square, to whom the demarche was made, he did not deny or question the fact that this film was real,” she said on the sidelines of the World Festival youth. Lambsdorff was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry on March 4. A diplomatic source told Izvestia that during communication with the ambassador at the department, in addition to discussing the recording of the conversation, “other issues were also touched upon.” The German diplomat stayed in the ministry building for more than an hour and then left it without answering journalists’ questions. On March 1, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion among senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, which, according to her data, took place February 19. During the conversation, the military discussed the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine. “Scholz will have to remove Pistorius from office” Member of the Bundestag Herold Otten - about the scandal in the Bundeswehr, the arms lobby in Germany and the conflict between the Russian Federation and NATO In a fragment of an audio recording of representatives of the German Air Force, officers discussed how many of these shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether there would be such a strike effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr Inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the authorities are promptly investigating the situation around publication of a recording of a conversation between German officers in Ukraine. He indicated that what happened was a “very serious problem.” Later, Bild reported that Graefe was to blame for the leak of the conversation, since during the conversation he was in Singapore and connected through an unsecured network. Later, on March 4, Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov noted that the recording of conversations between German officers demonstrates the involvement of Western countries in the conflict in Ukraine. In addition, Moscow hopes to get acquainted with the results of the investigation of the German authorities on this topic, Peskov said. The Ukrainian side is making attempts to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, as this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"25 November 2023","The blame for the breakdown of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in the spring of 2022 lies not only with former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, but also with his US allies. This opinion was expressed in a conversation with Izvestia on November 25 by the chairman of the Federation Council commission on protecting state sovereignty and preventing interference in the internal affairs of the Russian Federation, Andrei Klimov. Thus, the Russian senator commented on the statements of the head of the faction of the pro-presidential party of Ukraine “Servant of the People” in the Verkhovna Rada, David Arakhamia, in whom he reported that in 2022 Johnson dissuaded the Ukrainian side from signing peace agreements with Russia. “It seems to me that it is not Johnson alone who is to blame, and here we should not forget that the British imperialists act in very close connection with stronger and aggressive clans of the United States of America. They don’t just act together, but distribute roles among themselves,” Klimov explained. In his opinion, at that time it was more profitable for Washington to ensure that the ban on Kyiv from negotiating with Moscow came from London. In addition, the former prime minister left his post soon after, the Russian senator noted. “Thus, the Americans seemed to have nothing to do with it and continued to stigmatize us for everything. But Johnson is no longer in business, and little can be taken from him, unless, of course, he is brought to criminal liability under the laws of the same Ukraine,” Klimov added. At the same time, he emphasized that Johnson and all those who also bear responsibility for unleashing aggression against Russia on the territory of the former Ukrainian SSR, a place in the dock. In addition, the chairman of the Federation Council commission for the protection of state sovereignty stated that the modern Kiev regime was not initially an independent political entity and only received instructions from the outside and carried them out. “Initially, as soon as the actor [Vladimir] Zelensky was hired to play the role of the President of Ukraine, it was clear that this was done on purpose, because even his predecessors, such as [Petro] Poroshenko, [Viktor] Yanukovych and others, they still had political experience, had their own resources: personnel, financial, and so on. This one had nothing, he received everything from the outside, and he was controlled from the outside,” Klimov summed up. “There is now a Nazi regime in Kyiv, where opposition politicians are being killed” Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov talks about finding an alternative to Zelensky, the situation in the Northern Military District zone and the possibility of negotiations On November 25, ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern said that British Foreign Minister David Cameron forced Zelensky to conclude peace with the Russian Federation, in particular, threatened to withdraw his personal security. He also emphasized that the British actually have control over the security that surrounds Zelensky. “Moreover, he, apparently, was put on some kind of drugs, so here any manipulations are possible and it is clear that Ukraine was not turned into anti-Russia in order for the ex-actor to sign something with Russia.” On November 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia has never abandoned peace negotiations on Ukraine. The Russian leader also emphasized that any military action is always a tragedy, and indicated that “we must think about how to stop this tragedy.” In mid-October, Putin said that Ukraine needs to lift the decree prohibiting negotiations if it wants to begin the negotiation process . He noted that if earlier Kyiv stated the need to inflict a strategic defeat on the Russian Federation on the battlefield, now Ukrainian politicians have begun to point out the importance of holding peace negotiations. The last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place on March 29, 2022 in Istanbul. They lasted about three hours. Later, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow. On October 4, 2022, Zelensky put into effect the decision of the National Security and Defense Council on the impossibility of holding negotiations with Putin. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced on February 24 last year, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

He added that the EU must also complete a number of tasks that would allow it to accept new members into the association. Also on this day, political scientist, associate professor of the Department of European Studies at the Faculty of International Relations of St. Petersburg State University Dmitry Levi said that the EU can make a political decision on Ukraine’s accession, but this there will be acceptance with a number of exceptions, which will not bring real benefit to anyone. At the same time, he suggested, real accession will occur no earlier than in 15 years. President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky signed the application for the country’s accession to the EU on February 28, 2022. In April of the same year, Kyiv submitted to the European Union the completed second part of the questionnaire for obtaining the status of a candidate for accession to the EU, and in June the European Council agreed on the status of candidates for Ukraine and Moldova.

"May 19 2023","The European Union (EU) fears that the United States will weaken its support for Ukraine if the counter-offensive of its Armed Forces (AFU) is not successful. The Spanish newspaper El Pais reported this on May 19. Journalists believe that the United States does not want to supply some fighters to Kyiv, but is not against providing other types of weapons that can be used before a counter-offensive. Diplomatic sources cited by the publication believe that if Ukrainian troops continue to advance, then the States may allow the re-export of F-16s sold, for example, to the Netherlands. According to journalists, together with Denmark and Belgium, this country could provide Ukraine with about a hundred fighter jets. The USA and the EU promised to support Kyiv as much as needed, however, the newspaper’s journalists believe that Washington and Brussels have taken on different obligations in this matter. According to journalists, According to journalists, by this time the United States had spent $36.9 billion on military support for Ukraine, and the EU - $72 billion.

On May 14, Zelensky admitted that if the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is unsuccessful, less active countries may reduce assistance to Kyiv. He also added that Kyiv has neither the intention nor the sufficient number of weapons to strike Russian territory during the expected counter-offensive. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass. Moscow, for its part, sent a note to NATO countries regarding arms supplies. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov noted that any cargo that contains weapons for Ukraine will become a legitimate target for Russia.

"February 2024","The United States cannot catch up with the Russian Federation in the production of hypersonic weapons, so they are trying to downplay the potential of Russian weapons. This opinion was expressed on February 7 by Vladimir Ermakov, director of the department for nonproliferation and arms control at the Russian Foreign Ministry. “With regard to hypersonic systems, the Americans feel clearly wounded. For several years now, they have been unsuccessfully trying to catch up with Russia in terms of hypersonic systems, but have still not created a single prototype that satisfies the requirements and has been properly tested. Hence the senseless attempts to belittle the potential of Russian systems,” he pointed out in an interview with TASS. Ermakov said that Western countries are waging a propaganda campaign, publishing materials in the media attempting to cast doubt on the effectiveness of Russian weapons, for example, the Kinzhal missiles that are used in the zone of a special military operation. “This is pure propaganda and an attempt to impose its narratives on the world community using black PR methods,” the diplomat emphasized. In addition, Washington uses these methods, Ermakov believes, to promote its own anti-missile systems supplied to the Kyiv regime. Thus, the United States is trying in an exaggerated manner to show the reliability of its air and missile defense systems. The flight of the ""Dagger"": why it is impossible to repel the strike of a new hypersonic missile. It can destroy any target within a radius of several hundred kilometers in a matter of minutes. Before this, on January 24, the head of the Tactical Missile Weapons Corporation, Boris Obnosov, said that the Zircon hypersonic missile system is capable of overcome almost any enemy missile or air defense. He noted the extremely high characteristics of the missile system and emphasized that intercepting it would require a “very effective” missile defense system. On January 19, military expert and former member of the UN Disarmament Commission Igor Nikulin, in a conversation with Izvestia, doubted the effectiveness of Ukraine’s hybrid air defense system. provided by the USA. He pointed out that this is a previous generation system and is not designed for modern Russian missiles, especially hypersonic ones. Earlier, on December 23, Military Watch Magazine noted that the United States is expressing concern about the obsolescence of its nuclear arsenal amid the development of new hypersonic missiles by Russia and China rockets. Russia's ground-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force is currently the most combat-ready in the world, the authors admitted. Russian hypersonic weapons were presented in 2018. It includes the Avangard, Kinzhal complexes and Zircon missiles. In June 2021, the Russian President announced that Avangard and Kinzhal had already been put on combat duty in the Russian Federation Share: if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1646570'); } else { document.addEventListener('recommendationRunInit', function() { if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1646570'); } }); }",2024-02-20

Commenting on the words of French leader Emmanuel Macron that military personnel from the European Union (EU) countries could arrive in Ukraine in the future, she added that “nothing new Macron did not say.” Macron announced the possibility of sending his troops to Ukraine on February 26. His statement was not supported not only in France. The possibility of sending soldiers from Western countries was denied in the USA, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, Great Britain, Germany, Lithuania and Canada. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also spoke out against it. In addition, the absence of such plans was stated by the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Alliance Jens Stoltenberg. The official representative of the UN Secretary General Stephane Dujarric called for avoiding statements that could aggravate the Ukrainian conflict. Despite this, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, following Macron, allowed for the scenario of sending troops in the future. According to him, France will supposedly be next to Ukraine on Russia’s path. The country’s Ministry of Defense, in turn, explained that Macron’s words are not an attempt to start a war against Russia. And the head of the French Foreign Ministry said that the country's leadership allows the presence of Western military personnel on the territory of Ukraine to provide certain types of assistance, but without their participation in the conflict with Russia.

It is the police who identify them, determine their place of residence and deliver them to territorial centers,” the Ukrainian publication “Public” quotes him as saying. As Goncharuk noted, if a man is detained in another region, he will still be taken to the military registration and enlistment office. According to the publication, the number draft dodgers in the Chernigov region turned out to be approximately equal to the number of mobilized ones. Army of coercion: how a new wave of mobilization is taking place in Ukraine Men are caught in the streets, parking lots and ski resorts The day before it became known that in the Ivano-Frankivsk region of Ukraine it was temporarily prohibited to routinely hospitalize potential conscripts without the consent of the military registration and enlistment offices. At the same time, on June 16, general mobilization was announced in the region. Earlier, on June 11, Ukrainian army soldier Ivan Nechiporenko, who surrendered, said that in Ukraine even street cleaners hand out summonses to people, and those who did not manage to escape from them go to the front. According to the man, also in one of the statements of the leadership there was information that Ukrainian military personnel must buy their own uniforms to participate in hostilities. On June 4, it was reported that in the Kiev-controlled part of the Kherson region, men began to be taken to the Armed Forces of Ukraine right while receiving humanitarian aid. The publication Strana.ua reported on May 26 that over the past month, Ukrainian courts have handed down about 100 sentences for evading mobilization. It is noted that the courts, as a rule, impose three years of imprisonment as a punishment with a probationary period of one or two years. Prior to this, on May 8, an activist of the Nikolaev underground said that in the city all men were indiscriminately taken away and taken to mobilization points On April 27, a video appeared on the Internet of supposedly forced mobilization in the Ukrainian Cherkassy. The presented footage shows how military registration and enlistment office employees caught and beat a man. One of the military registration and enlistment office employees hit him in the face, after which two others knocked the man to the ground, where he was also kicked. Prior to this, on April 18, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained a train conductor who was helping men of military age to leave for the EU . It was noted that the employee hid men who wanted to leave Ukraine in the ventilation shaft, where they were while going through passport control.

"31 August 2023","Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said Kyiv needs about 160 F-16 fighter jets to prevent Russian pilots from dominating the airspace. The Ukrainian leader announced this figure on Thursday, August 31, in an interview with RTP TV channel. “Today we have an agreement on the future supply of 50-60 fighters. Why am I saying this? Because at different times we will have different numbers of fighters. <...> In total, we need about 160 fighters to have a powerful air force that will not give Russia the opportunity to dominate the airspace,” he said. At the same time, Zelensky added that the deliveries of fighters promised by the West are happening “later than he wanted” and that Russian dominance in the skies is “absolute.” Fighters should appear in the skies of Ukraine early next year, Zelensky also noted, acknowledging that the issue is complex because it requires training not only pilots, but also engineers and other support personnel. To the downed pilots: how the delivery of F-16s to Kyiv will change the battlefield And what these machines are capable of in the hands of Ukrainian pilots Also on Thursday, Advisor to the command of the country's air force Yuriy Ignat said that Kiev needs 60 F-16 fighters to carry out combat missions On the same day, The New York Times, citing American officials, stated that Kyiv is trying to coordinate the supply of F-16 fighters as quickly as possible against the backdrop of a possible change in the political situation in Western countries. According to the publication, Zelensky’s statements about receiving fighter jets in the future are aimed at securing Western commitments if the failed counteroffensive affects the mood of politicians. Zelensky on August 20 announced that he had reached an agreement with the Danish authorities on the supply of F-16s. Danish Defense Minister Jakob Ellemann-Jensen clarified that 19 fighters will be transferred. Zelensky also reached an agreement with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on the supply of F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv. The Ukrainian president said that a total of 42 aircraft would be delivered to Kyiv. The day before, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said that deliveries of F-16s to Ukraine have serious consequences. According to him, Russia views the appearance of fighters of this type in the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a threat to security in the nuclear sphere. The diplomat called the supply of F-16s an insane decision, which is being made against the backdrop of awareness of the impasse into which Washington has driven itself. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022 .

"March 27 2023","Russia's calls to return US nuclear weapons from abroad have been ignored, so Moscow has the right to take additional steps for its security. This was stated on Monday, March 27, by the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova in her Telegram channel. She noted that the inadequate reaction of Western countries to the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus causes bewilderment among the department. “In the conditions of the total attack unleashed by the West against Russia hybrid war and the declared intention of the United States and NATO to inflict a “strategic defeat” on us, it would be naive to continue to count on the complete absence of any military-technical countermeasures on our part in this area,” she emphasized. Bombs for guns: what kind of “small” nuclear weapons does Russia have? Today they are increasingly being talked about in the international arena. Earlier, on March 25, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Moscow and Minsk agreed to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus without violating the nonproliferation regime. He emphasized that Russia is not transferring its nuclear weapons to Belarus, but is doing what the United States has been doing for a decade. The next day, former Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Zivadin Yovanovic said that the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus is a response to the actions collective West. Yovanovitch noted that the Russian-Belarusian agreement came after Great Britain announced plans to supply the Kyiv regime with depleted uranium shells, which could also be considered “the beginning of the use of nuclear weapons against Russian troops and Russia.” He added that NATO propaganda is trying to reduce the danger of these weapons, which are “weapons of mass destruction of people and the living world.” Political scientist Kirill Averyanov, in a conversation with Izvestia, expressed the opinion that Russia’s decision to deploy tactical nuclear weapons may have a deterrent nature for the West. As the expert emphasized, it indicates that “Russian-Belarusian integration in the military sphere today is at its highest point.” On February 16, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said that the republic does not need strategic nuclear weapons. However, she has an interest in tactical weapons. According to Lukashenko, Minsk does not intend to launch strikes “even on European countries,” but plans to prepare aircraft that can carry tactical nuclear weapons.

According to him, the United Kingdom allocated £4.7 billion in aid to Kyiv during the specified period. The Deputy Foreign Minister calculated the total amount as part of a response to a corresponding parliamentary request from member of the British House of Lords Dale Campbell-Savors. Ahmad emphasized in his response that the UK will continue support Ukraine until a “just and lasting peace based on the UN Charter” is achieved. “This includes financial support of more than £4.2 billion through loan guarantees and World Bank grants; £357 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and the region; £150 million to support Ukraine's energy security and resilience; £2.5 million in support of the domestic prosecution of Ukraine for international crimes,” Lenta.Ru quotes the deputy head of the British Foreign Office. Earlier, on February 15, the Russian Embassy in London said that British Foreign Minister David Cameron, insisting on providing military assistance to Ukraine , condones Nazism, like his predecessors 90 years ago. In addition, Russian diplomats pointed out the cynical arguments of Cameron, who called military support for Kyiv an investment in the security of the West. On February 13, the US Senate approved aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan in the amount of $95 billion, reports NSN. At the same time, The Guardian noted that the project has little chance of passing the House of Representatives, since Speaker Mike Johnson criticized it for the lack of provisions put forward by Republicans to stop the record flow of migrants on the border with Mexico. In turn, US President Joe Biden said, that he is confident of a positive voting result in the full House of Representatives of the American Congress regarding the aid package bill. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022.

"March 2024","The conflict between Ukraine and Poland in the trade sphere has brought benefits to Russia, and it did not provoke this crisis. The Politico newspaper reported this on March 6. The publication noted that problems with blocking the passage of Ukrainian transport with grain on the Polish-Ukrainian border emphasized Russia’s position as the world’s leading exporter of cereal crops. Russian agricultural products, according to Politico, move freely throughout Europe: for example, they are imported into Poland across the border with Belarus, and no obstacles are created for carriers there. As Gazeta.Ru adds, Poland itself is among the buyers of products from the Russian agricultural sector, and by this, in fact, blocks and isolates Ukraine, which he calls his ally. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk blamed Russian imports for the losses of Polish farmers and the crisis at the border, but Politico noted that there is nothing to prove his words. The publication recalled that in January Latvia tried to achieve a ban on the import of agricultural products from the Russian Federation throughout the European Union (EU), but failed because other states, such as Spain and Italy, were not ready to impose such an embargo because they are large buyers of Russian grain and cannot refuse it. Politico also emphasizes that Russian food is not subject to Western sanctions that prohibit the purchase and import of energy resources and some other goods from the Russian Federation. The border is locked: Poland has threatened to stop the transit of goods from Ukraine According to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, such a measure will be painful for both countries. Earlier, on March 6, Polish Minister of Agriculture Czeslaw Sekierski said that Warsaw and Kyiv are trying to avoid a complete closure of the common border for cargo transportation. There is currently an embargo on wheat, sunflower, corn and rapeseed, but further bans, he said, will harm the Polish economy. Polish farmers regularly block roads in the republic. On March 1, they blocked local highway No. 15 and demanded a meeting with the Prime Minister of their country, Donald Tusk. They added that they are not afraid of the police and do not want to see Deputy Minister of Agriculture Michal Kolodziejczak. Farmers are demanding the introduction of an embargo on the supply of agricultural products from Ukraine and the state’s withdrawal from the EU Green Deal program, which concerns the achievement of carbon neutrality in the alliance countries by 2050. At six checkpoints on the Polish-Ukrainian border on February 27, there were a total of 2, 1 thousand trucks that were stuck due to blocked checkpoints. Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine Alexander Kubrakov said that on February 25, unknown persons poured approximately 160 tons of Ukrainian grain from sealed wagons, which were being transported to the port of Gdansk. He called the incident “impunity and irresponsibility,” recalling that this is the fourth such case. Polish carriers and farmers began blocking automobile checkpoints on the border with Ukraine in early November last year. Among their demands was the introduction of commercial permits for Ukrainian carriers and a limit on the number of Ukrainian heavy trucks entering Poland.

Knockout for the mayor: what will the conflict between Zelensky and Klitschko lead to? Ukrainian politicians quarreled over bomb shelters. On June 2, the website of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky published a petition calling for the removal of the mayor of Kyiv from his duties. The reason was, according to the authors of the initiative, the poor organization of the work of air-raid shelters in the city. A week later, the Minister for Strategic Industries of Ukraine, Alexander Kamyshin, announced that, following an inspection of the condition of air-raid shelters in Kyiv, only 15% of the 4,655 shelters were suitable. Later, 13 June, Klitschko announced that the Kyiv authorities will allocate more than $8 million for the purchase and installation of modular shelters.

"23 May 2023","The past three-day G7 summit in Hiroshima may become a turning point in the context of Western support for Ukraine. Financial Times columnist Gideon Rahman said this on Monday, May 22. “The danger is that this (G7 summit. - Ed.) may be remembered as the high point of support for Ukraine,” he wrote. According to the author publication, the transfer of weapons, supplies and equipment to Kyiv has already depleted reserves in the United States and Europe. Against this background, the failure of the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) will be a decisive argument for reducing supplies. In addition, much depends on the results of the presidential race in the United States. If the country is led by Republican Donald Trump, Ukraine most likely will not be able to rely on Washington, as it does under Joe Biden. Moreover, a change in the foreign policy course in the States will inevitably affect the priorities of the entire collective West. Summarizing the above, Rahman admitted that the level of political, financial and logistical support for Ukraine may sharply decrease in the foreseeable future. Behind seven sorrows: how the summit of G7 leaders ended and what new restrictions the West introduced against Russia In May, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky visited a number of European states and took part in the G7 summit in Hiroshima in order to increase financial and material support for Kyiv. He was able to obtain a new package of military aid worth $375 million from the United States and a promise from the West to continue supplying weapons after the conflict was resolved. Russia, in turn, has repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Ukraine. In April, the Russian Foreign Ministry sent a note to all NATO countries regarding arms supplies to Kyiv, and the head of the ministry, Sergei Lavrov, noted that any cargo that contains weapons for the Ukrainian army will become a legitimate target for Russia. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the background Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

Without resolving this issue, Kyiv should not even dream of joining the EU,” the diplomat said on ZET radio. He added that if Warsaw wants to be in the same union with Ukraine and make peace with it, then this serious controversial issue must be resolved , otherwise it will be very difficult for both parties to cooperate.

He received the rank of US Air Force enlisted 1st Class, which is third in the military service's ranking list. Teixeira was awarded the US Air Force Achievement Medal, which is a standard award for military personnel with similar length of service. The leak of two large batches of classified Pentagon documents became known on April 6. We are talking about about 100 documents that relate to Kyiv’s combat capabilities, NATO support and the vulnerability of the Ukrainian army. It also follows from documents leaked online that the United States is listening in on South Korea, Israel, and Ukraine. Against this backdrop, several countries demanded an explanation from the United States. On April 8, the US Department of Justice began an investigation into the leak. According to a source from The Washington Post, some of the documents were prepared in the winter for the Chairman of the Committee of the Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces, Mark Milley, and other military personnel. At the same time, “hundreds, if not thousands” of military department employees had access to classified information.

"14 February 2024","The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will not be able to win the conflict with Russia and regain lost territories. This was stated by the editor of the German newspaper Die Welt, Stefan Aust, in the Maishberger program on the Das Erste channel on February 13. “Now the situation does not look as if Ukraine can win and oust the Russians from the lost territories,” he said. The newspaper editor also noted that it is necessary begin negotiations to resolve the conflict. In addition, Aust believes that every effort should have been made to avoid SVO from the very beginning. Trial window: the Russian Federation allows negotiations with Kiev in a Western country Which state besides Hungary could become a mediator between Moscow and Kiev On Wednesday, February 14, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during his speech during the “government hour” in the State Duma, announced his readiness Russian Federation to negotiations on Ukraine, taking into account the interests of Moscow. Lavrov emphasized that at the moment there is no desire on the part of “those who declared war on us” to take into account the interests of the Russian Federation and “realities on earth.” Therefore, it will not be possible to talk at the negotiating table yet, he added. Earlier, on February 12, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN Dmitry Polyansky said that Western countries are not making serious efforts to conduct a dialogue with Russia on the topic of settlement in Ukraine. At the same time, he denied assumptions about a hidden negotiation process. Representatives of Western countries are indeed inclined to continue the conflict in Ukraine. Thus, on January 30, the head of the foreign policy service of the European Union, Josep Borrell, said that the idea of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine on a truce was initially wrong, and the defeat of the Russian Federation on the battlefield is the best guarantee of security. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded that the Russian Federation has never refused negotiations with Ukraine on the topic of the conflict. In an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson, which was released on February 9, Putin expressed confidence that Russia and Ukraine will sooner or later come to an agreement and relations between peoples will be restored. In the same interview, he recalled that it is the Ukrainian side that shows reluctance to engage in dialogue, because it is the president Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky signed a document banning any negotiations with the Russian Federation. The last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul on March 29, 2022. They lasted about three hours. Later, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow. On October 4 of the same year, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky enacted the decision of the country's National Security and Defense Council on the impossibility of holding negotiations with Putin.

"March 6 2024","The West needs a long conflict in Ukraine, and politicians decide to carry out sabotage against Russia for this purpose. This opinion was expressed by journalist Mehmet Ali Güller in his article for the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet on Wednesday, March 6. “There are two ways: either they will send their military to Ukraine, or they will export a “special war” there,” said the author of the publication. He emphasized that sending military personnel from Western countries to help Kyiv is impossible, so the second option remains. By “special war” Güller means sabotage, expansion of “training missions” in Ukraine and more. “They (Western countries - Ed.) will try to keep the conflict <...> in a heated state through dirty work,” the journalist wrote. According to him In his opinion, one example would be the undermining of the Nord Streams and the opening of US CIA bases in Ukraine. Güller said that the consequences of such actions would be much more serious for the West itself than for Russia. He pointed to rising energy prices, accelerating inflation, impoverishment of the population, and also recalled the ongoing protests by farmers. Mushroom on the horizon: in the West there is talk of sending troops to Ukraine The French President called to prevent Russia from winning. On March 1, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion among senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, which, according to her data, took place on 19 February. During the conversation, the military discussed the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine. A fragment of an audio recording from representatives of the German Air Force said that the officers discussed how many such shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether such a strike would be effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr Inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the authorities are promptly investigating the situation around publication of a recording of a conversation between German officers in Ukraine. He indicated that what happened was a “very serious problem.” In turn, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov noted that the recording of negotiations between German officers demonstrates the involvement of Western countries in the conflict in Ukraine. In addition, Moscow hopes to get acquainted with the results of the investigation of the German authorities on this topic. At the end of February, The New York Times reported that over the past eight years, a network of secret military bases has been built in Ukraine along the border with Russia with funds from the US CIA. According to the publication’s interlocutors, these bases include a military bunker of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), built entirely with CIA funds, which serves as a secret control center for the Ukrainian army. As noted by the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova, the CIA and other US intelligence services and The UK, long before 2022, was working on establishing its “strong points” in Ukraine and training spies for Kyiv. In addition, Zakharova recalled how the Russian side had repeatedly, long before 2022, stated that NATO and the intelligence services of NATO structures were establishing bases or strongholds in Ukraine. And we are talking not only about the line along the border with Russia, but about the entire territory of the country. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by the Russian President on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce aid to Ukraine.

"12 August 2023","Captured Ukrainian marine Vladimir Reul said that during the retreat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), he was abandoned by his own colleagues, and then handed over to Russian troops by the security service (SBU) that recruited him. His story was reported by RIA Novosti on Saturday, August 12. According to Reul, in 2022, near Kopan in the Kherson region, his unit was forced to retreat from the approaching Russian army. Due to the negligence of his own commanders, the Marine remained in Russian-controlled territory. He decided to hide his weapon so as not to give away his affiliation with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After that, he settled in the region under the guise of a peaceful local resident. Six months later, the Marine was identified by the SBU. An intelligence officer offered Reul to work as an intelligence officer on Russian territory, after which he promised to help him return to his country. “Igor Babak, an SBU officer from Novaya Kakhovka, came out and gave the task of giving the coordinates of the deployment of the troops of the Russian Federation. In exchange, he promised to transport me across the river to the controlled territory of Ukraine,” the marine said about the details of the agreement with the Ukrainian special services. After the marine fulfilled his part of the agreement, Babak promised to ensure his safe transportation to the territory of Ukraine. “He gave the phone number of the person who should was to transport me to the controlled territory of Ukraine. When I came to a certain place, I had to say the call sign “Galicia,” Reul said about the plan to escape from Russian-controlled lands. However, the SBU betrayed him, handing him over to the Russian side. Upon arrival at the agreed place, Reul gave the password, after which he was immediately arrested by Russian military personnel. The prisoner said that he was deceived, used for his own purposes “as cannon fodder.” Repelled forces: in two months, the UAF lost more than 43 thousand people. The Russian army destroyed most of the group prepared for the Ukrainian “counter-offensive.” On August 11, Ukrainian Armed Forces prisoner of war Ivan told Izvestia about forced mobilization in the country and the lack of proper preparation for combat operations. According to him, the summons was handed to him by stopping the car at the traffic police post. Earlier, on August 8, a captive intelligence officer of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, squad commander Vasily Paliy said that the counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine actually failed, and the losses suffered by the Ukrainian troops were large. According to him, the tasks of the counteroffensive were not explained to the military, and Ukrainian intelligence “exists only on paper.” The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"19 March 2023","The United States will stop supporting Ukraine if the political course changes. A corresponding position was expressed by columnist Randeep Ramesh in an article for The Guardian published on March 18. In his opinion, Washington has already changed the direction of its political views in its history, regardless of the interests of its allies, acting according to the formula “either with us or against us.” For a country, political success is more important than following moral ideas. This was the case with Iraq, he noted. The United States was ready to “part with old allies in order to bomb the Middle East in a form that suits them.” “After the recent travails of Iraq, there is a warning for Ukraine: in American politics, success comes first and no moral laws are binding. For all the talk of “unwavering support,” there are domestic limits to the U.S. military casualties that Iraq has helped revive,” the article said. The author suggested that US President Joe Biden will rely on the views of Republican presidential candidates who say that defending Ukraine is not a vital US interest. Moreover, Washington will not be willing to keep pace with public opinion in large swaths of the globe for too long, since the United States is accustomed to the role of “sheriff of the world.” They said on TV: how the perception of the Ukrainian crisis in the United States is changing As the SVO continues, enthusiasm in American society is fading. Earlier that day, participants in a rally near the White House called on the United States to stop aid to Kyiv, abandon militarism and sanctions policy, and disband NATO. Banners condemning the aggressive US policy towards China were also seen. Also on March 18, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that the United States has not spared either Ukrainians or Russians for a long time, continuing to supply weapons to Kyiv. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the background Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which the Russian authorities announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"November 28 2023","On the Polish-Ukrainian border in Przemysl and at the entrance to the border village of Medyka in Poland, drivers from Ukraine blocked roads in response to the same blocking by Polish motorists. The Polish radio station RMF24 reported this on November 28, citing a message from its hotline. “Now I’m traveling from Przemysl to Medyka. Ukrainian drivers are protesting; they have blocked two crossings. They are walking on pedestrian crossings, so if possible, avoid this section of the road,” one listener told the radio station. The protests are reported to be taking place at a roundabout on the eastern outskirts of Przemyśl, where the national road No. 28, which leads to the border crossing, passes in Medyka. The Przemysl police told radio station journalists that periodically a group of about 30 people enters pedestrian crossings for several minutes or longer, blocking traffic. “The protests are taking place in a peaceful atmosphere, and their initiators do not hide the fact that they are a response on Polish drivers blocking the passage of Ukrainian trucks,” the journalists note.

Earlier this day, Polish authorities called on Ukraine to urgently fulfill the demands of Polish carriers who are blocking the border. Drivers are calling for the elimination of the requirement for registration in the electronic queue of vehicles returning from Ukraine to the European Union (EU) without cargo, at least at two border crossings - Zosin-Ustilug and Nizhankovichi-Malchowice. Carriers from Poland began to block automobile checkpoints on the border with Ukraine in the beginning of November. They demanded the introduction of commercial permits for Ukrainian carriers and limiting their number. Because of this, huge queues of trucks have accumulated at the border. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said on November 25 that the country is experiencing difficulties on the border with Poland due to the “political steps” of its neighbors. He indicated that the authorities have already begun to work to resolve the conflict. On the same day, Lviv Mayor Andrei Sadovoy called on Poland to immediately end the “shameful blockade” of the border with Ukraine. He noted that all the positive actions of Warsaw for Kyiv are nullified by a “group of fringes” who are blocking the supply of humanitarian goods. Polish carriers announced that the protest action will continue until February 1 next year; on November 23, supplies of military cargo to Ukraine were also blocked. On November 19, it was reported that interruptions in the delivery of some goods began in Ukraine due to the blocking of the border. At the same time, the vice-president of the Association of International Road Carriers (ASMAP) Vladimir Balin said that Kyiv and Warsaw intend to sue over problems with blocking traffic at the border. The protesters demand, first of all, the restoration of permits for international transport, canceled in 2022 by agreement with The European Union and Ukraine.

"March 2023","At the Mariupol airport, Ukrainian militants of the radical nationalist group “Azov” (a terrorist organization banned on the territory of the Russian Federation) set up a torture chamber. This was reported on Tuesday, March 7, on the official website of the Investigative Committee of Russia. According to eyewitnesses, Ukrainian militants tortured civilians in a torture chamber at the airport and then shot them. Afterwards, the dead were buried nearby. As part of the investigation into the incidents, investigators plan to inspect the airport. Facts of torture of civilians will be assessed from a legal point of view.

"11 February 2024","The successful defense of the Russian army at the front forced NATO countries to rethink their defense strategy. The Economist magazine reported this, citing experts, on February 10. “European officials are concerned that Russia's breakneck rearmament is outpacing Europe's efforts to ramp up arms production. The leaders of the Baltic countries emphasize that even a small advance by Russia could pose an existential threat to their states,” the publication notes. As the publication emphasizes, the fortifications of the Russian Armed Forces in the south and east of Ukraine have become the largest defensive structures in Europe since the Second World War. “ Russia's successful defense has also prompted a broader rethink. Russian fortifications in southern and eastern Ukraine were the largest defensive installations in Europe since World War II, according to an analysis by the American think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, the magazine reports. This situation at the front poses a dilemma for NATO members. They preferred an elastic defense, which allows them to delay the enemy by engaging in a clash in positions more favorable to themselves, the article notes. Step by step inaccessibility: NATO's strategy on Ukraine has reached a dead end The West does not believe in its own promises of assistance to Kiev On January 26, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova advised the member states of the North Atlantic Alliance to realize the need to reconsider their hostile approach to Russia and abandon the course of the bloc’s harmful expansion to the east Prior to this, on January 23, members of the new German party “Sarah Wagenknecht Union” - former diplomat Michael von der Schulenburg and former member of the German Bundestag Fabio De Masi - criticized NATO and advocated a ceasefire and negotiations on Ukraine. In particular, Schulenburg called the reason for the start of a special military operation by Russia the planned expansion of the alliance into Ukrainian territory. On January 14, Bild, citing a “secret document” of the Bundeswehr, reported that Germany is preparing for a military clash between NATO and Russia, which, according to the scenario of the country’s Ministry of Defense, may occur in 2025. It is assumed that in the spring of 2024, Russia will launch a large-scale offensive in Ukraine and defeat the Ukrainian armed forces by June. After which, in October, Moscow will allegedly transfer troops and weapons to the Kaliningrad region, where an escalation of the border conflict with the Baltic countries may begin in December. In 2025, on Day X, the commander-in-chief of NATO forces will give the order to transfer 300 thousand alliance soldiers to the eastern flank.

"15 May 2023","The armored vehicles that France will transfer to Ukraine in the coming weeks will not even be enough for a brigade. Military expert Vladislav Shurygin told Izvestia about this on May 15. The day before it became known that France would equip several battalions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) with dozens of armored vehicles, including light wheeled tanks AMX-10RC. “Supplies of any weapons are dangerous because that it drives, shoots and kills. But it is obvious that what they supply will not be enough even for a brigade kit. These are simply extreme supplies of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in replacement of what was lost over these months, and within the framework of everything that [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky begged for during his trip,” the expert said. According to him, Zelensky argued that Kyiv was given a lot , but it’s still not enough for a successful offensive. “So France is dumping all sorts of African junk, which can be used very conditionally in normal wars. Wheeled tanks are actually armored vehicles armed with cannons,” concluded Shurygin.

In her opinion, sending weapons to Kyiv is a fact of interference in the conflict and leads to its escalation. Marechal also expressed regret that European countries do not seek to resolve the situation and do not sit down at the negotiating table. Moscow has repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Kyiv.

"21 June 2023","The former head of France's military mission to the UN, General Dominique Trencant, explained the country's decision to support Ukraine if it intends to join NATO. He spoke about this on Tuesday, June 20, in a conversation with Marianne. The general noted that France will take Ukraine’s side in joining the North Atlantic Alliance for two reasons. The first is that the French authorities do not want a conflict with the countries of Eastern Europe, which vote for Kyiv’s membership in the bloc. Secondly, Paris intends to move the Ukrainian conflict from a dead point. Thus, he said, France is trying to promote the initiative for peace negotiations. However, Trencan stressed that France recommends admitting Ukraine to NATO only after the end of the conflict. “Therefore, let Ukraine fight alone for now, without NATO.

The day before, the director of the second department of the CIS countries of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Alexei Polishchuk, said that close cooperation between Kyiv and NATO is delaying the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. He noted that if the West really cared about security guarantees, then NATO and the United States would insist on the neutral and non-aligned status of Kyiv.

People’s Deputy Inna Sovsun said that after the end of the conflict, people’s hopes will be difficult to justify, and Lviv deputy Nikolai Knyazhitsky accused Zelensky of using wartime circumstances to seize power and control over the press. Former US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter said on April 15 that Zelensky for Ukrainians will become the personification of the collapse of the country due to dead soldiers and compatriots who left their homeland.

State Duma deputy from the Republic of Crimea Mikhail Sheremet stated this on October 20. Thus, he commented on the American president’s statement made the day before that assistance to Ukraine and Israel is a “smart investment” and will bring dividends to future generations. “The Biden administration will only lead the United States to greater tension and decline to civil confrontation. Residents of the country no longer believe him, because with his dictatorial and Nazi policies he destroyed their American dream, betrayed democracy, deprived them of their former social guarantees and confidence in the future,” Sheremet told RIA Novosti. According to the deputy, Biden continues his course towards creating centers of chaos and war around the world, but with his unbridled desire to harm other countries and subjugate them, he drove himself into a stalemate. In this regard, Sheremet noted that the US President should learn the famous Russian proverb: “Don’t dig a hole for someone else, you will fall into it yourself.” Crisis control: what goals are the United States pursuing in the Middle East conflict? The White House faces the need to solve a number of difficult problems. On October 19, Biden spoke about sending an emergency budget request to Congress to finance Israel and Ukraine. He called the purpose of this request “support for critical partners,” including Israel and Ukraine, without voicing the exact amount. His words about the “reasonableness” of “these investments” were also previously commented on by the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova, noting that the current US dividends are made by calculation and on blood. On October 18, American political scientist Malek Dudakov said in a conversation with Izvestia that for It will be difficult for the US President to ask Congress for aid for Israel and Ukraine amid the rift.

On October 15, Biden said that the United States has the opportunity to simultaneously support Ukraine and Israel. He noted that the United States will be able to ensure “international security.” Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass.

Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev stated this on March 27 in a conversation with Rossiyskaya Gazeta. According to him, the White House uses “democratic slogans.” “By proclaiming democratic slogans inappropriately and inappropriately, in fact, Washington has long become champion in violating the sovereignty of states, in the number of wars and conflicts unleashed, in the brutal and illegal hunting of citizens of other countries,” he noted. Patrushev added that if the United States really decides to move towards democracy and “stops humiliating its allies - vassals, we We will only welcome this.” At present, Washington’s main task remains to mislead the Americans in the context of the systemic crisis in which the United States finds itself, the Secretary of the Russian Security Council emphasized. They said on TV: how the perception of the Ukrainian crisis in the United States is changing As the NWO continues, enthusiasm in American society is fading. In the same interview, Patrushev noted that NATO countries have created a large military camp out of Ukraine in an effort to defeat Russia on the battlefield and dismember it. Washington is sending Kyiv weapons, providing intelligence data, including from satellites, he added. Earlier in March, the Security Council Secretary noted that Western countries led by the United States continue to pump Ukraine with weapons, train neo-Nazis and help Kyiv in planning military actions.

The newspaper Le Monde reported this on Tuesday, June 20, citing sources. The publication notes that today Paris supports Ukraine’s potential entry into the alliance. The French side expects that such a step will influence the course of the conflict and help achieve the resumption of negotiations. France outlined its new position on the eve of the annual NATO summit, which will be held on July 11-12 in Vilnius. Today, the countries of Central Europe, primarily Poland and the Baltic states, are actively in favor of Ukraine’s membership in the alliance.

The day before, the director of the second department of the CIS countries of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Alexei Polishchuk, said that close cooperation between Kyiv and NATO is delaying the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. He noted that if the West really cared about security guarantees, then NATO and the United States would insist on the neutral and non-aligned status of Kyiv. At the same time, one of the reasons for the current crisis is ignoring the interests of Moscow. On June 18, Czech President Petr Pavel stressed that the process of Ukraine’s accession to NATO cannot begin at a time when there is still a military conflict.

At the same time, Bloomberg connects the rejection of Hungary's objections with the fact that pressure is growing on the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban over the issue of Sweden's admission to NATO. Stockholm and Helsinki submitted applications to join the bloc in May 2022, but the ratification of their membership was delayed. Later, on April 4, 2023, only Finland officially joined the alliance. Let's go from principles: they want to deprive Hungary of the right to vote What mechanisms does this lay down and will Budapest stop making contributions to the EU budget? Hungary, at a meeting in Brussels on Ukraine, which took place on December 14–15, blocked the allocation of €50 billion to Kyiv. In the same month, the Prime Minister Hungarian Minister Viktor Orban suggested that the EU refrain from aid to Ukraine over the next five years, noting that the €50 billion that the union is going to transfer to Kyiv simply does not exist. On January 22, Bloomberg wrote that the EU plans to accept an aid package to Kyiv on February 1 at a summit in Brussels. If Hungary blocks the initiative again, the alliance countries will deprive it of its voting rights and make a decision without it.

We need a modification of the F-16 that can provide an advantage in the air over Russian equipment,” Ignat noted on the Ukrainian TV channel Rada.

"23 January 2024","Traditionally, Switzerland, located at the center of the European continent, has created the conditions for peace between different parties, but now it is difficult for it to advocate neutrality, being under external pressure. Vice-President of the Geneva branch of the Swiss People's Party Alexandre Chevalier stated this on January 23 in an interview with Izvestia. “Now the restoration of the central role of Switzerland at the level of peaceful dialogue seems to me extremely important. <…> But again, we cannot do this under external pressure from organizations such as the European Union, and we cannot do this without all the people who are parties to the conflict,” he noted. According to Chevalier, it is absolutely clear , that negotiations can only take place if “everyone is at the table.” Therefore, the idea of holding negotiations without Russia’s participation is “absurd.” The politician also noted that Switzerland was built on the fact that it had not taken part in conflicts for more than two centuries and was the center of peace for other nations. Now, according to him, Europe is in a situation where everything is heading into a quagmire, which “could last as long as the Vietnam War,” so it is so necessary to remember the country’s neutrality and a speedy resolution of the conflict. “Switzerland must play its role.” . In addition, Geneva, as I am particularly concerned, being involved in politics here, must remain an international center for dialogue and peace,” concluded Chevalier. He hoped for Davos: the “Zelensky formula” is failing Ukraine’s plan does not find support among the countries of the Global South Earlier, on January 21, Russian Ambassador to Switzerland Sergei Garmonin, in an interview with the Sonntags Zeitung newspaper, said that Switzerland had lost the authority of a non-partisan international platform and cannot be considered as mediator in resolving the Ukrainian conflict. He recalled that the country “consistently supports the anti-Russian line of the collective West and has joined illegitimate sanctions.” Earlier that day, Member of the European Parliament from the German Alternative for Germany party Gunnar Beck, in a conversation with Izvestia, said that the “Peace Conference” on Ukraine , which Swiss President Viola Amherd proposed to hold in 2024, will not bring any results if Russia is not invited there. On January 20, Amherd announced Switzerland’s desire to hold a “peace conference” on Ukraine this year in an interview with the newspaper Schweiz am Wochenende. At the same time, she believes that Russia is unlikely to participate in this summit and doubts the possibility of achieving great results at the meeting. On January 16, Swiss National Council member Rino Büchel said that Switzerland should invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to Bern to confirm its neutrality in Ukrainian conflict. According to him, resolving the conflict in Ukraine is unthinkable without the participation of Russia. The parliamentarian considered the negotiations in Davos regarding the Ukrainian “peace formula” absurd. Prior to this, on January 14, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said during a meeting that Western countries “must, one way or another” find a way to include Russia in the process of resolving the conflict in Ukraine. According to him, there will be no peace if Russia cannot say its word.

In addition, Karasev noted that if the Armed Forces of Ukraine actually end up facing a similar situation, then Western countries may decide to provoke a new conflict, but on the territory of Transnistria, in order to shift the focus of the Russian Armed Forces.

The diplomat noted that here the matter lies “in the position of our Ukrainian “partners” and their Western sponsors.” “It seems to me that our position is absolutely clear. The point is not that there are no parties who would like to act as mediators. We welcome these efforts of all friendly countries,” she said. The Russian Ambassador recalled that last year in 2023, Indonesian Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto already put forward an initiative for a peaceful settlement during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. “How did it all end? The Ukrainians literally said no after 5 minutes. We were ready to consider such initiatives if officially approached to us. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs [of the Russian Federation] Andrei Rudenko said this. But the Ukrainians immediately said no,” the diplomat said. Swiss scales: the Russian Federation does not see Bern as a mediator in negotiations with Ukraine What the confederation is seeking and who in Europe is ready for dialogue with Moscow Earlier, on February 14 of this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during his speech during the government hour in the State Duma, announced the readiness of the Russian Federation to negotiations on Ukraine, taking into account the interests of Moscow. Lavrov emphasized that at the moment there is no desire on the part of “those who declared war on us” to take into account the interests of the Russian Federation and “realities on earth.” Therefore, it will not be possible to talk at the negotiating table yet, he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded that the Russian Federation has never refused negotiations with Ukraine on the topic of the conflict. In an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson, which was published on February 9, Putin expressed confidence that Russia and Ukraine will sooner or later come to an agreement and relations between the peoples will be restored. In June 2023, the head of the Indonesian Ministry of Defense, Prabowo Subianto, held two separate meetings with the ambassadors of Russia and Ukraine on the proposed them a peaceful plan. The initiative includes, inter alia, a ceasefire, the creation of a demilitarized zone and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force. The Russian Foreign Ministry, in turn, noted the similarity of Indonesia’s plan with the Minsk agreements. Afterwards, Mikhail Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, said that negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv are based on any peace initiatives, including those proposed by Brazil, Indonesia and African countries, impossible. He also called these plans dangerous and “murderous” for Ukraine and Europe. The last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul on March 29, 2022. They lasted about three hours. Later, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow. On October 4 of the same year, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky put into effect the decision of the country's National Security and Defense Council on the impossibility of holding negotiations with Putin.

"August 2 2023","Ideas about annexing the territories of Western Ukraine are becoming mainstream in Poland, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday, August 2. “In recent years, the theme has been that this very historical justice must finally be accomplished, and they see it in the context of Western Ukraine , is becoming mainstream,” Zakharova said on Sputnik radio. She emphasized that the topic of claims to Ukrainian territories has already gone beyond marginal discussions and is beginning to become mainstream in Polish society. “Books appear here and there, here and there Conferences are held, speeches are given one after another. Either a stamp will be issued, or a coin will be minted with certain nostalgic memories,” said the official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “The Kiev regime does not represent Ukraine” Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov - about the future of the western regions of his country and the authors of the “Zelensky plan” The day before, Zakharova noted that Kyiv began to suspect that Warsaw’s help could result in the seizure of the western lands of Ukraine by Poland. She also compared the relationship between Warsaw and Kyiv with a wolf and a sheep, saying that the herbivore began to guess that it would go to dinner for the wolf. On July 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation, Sergei Naryshkin, to monitor Warsaw’s plans regarding Kyiv and stated that Poland hopes to directly intervene in the conflict and “tear off a fatter piece” in Ukraine. Earlier, on July 11, Polish President Andrzej Duda allowed the Polish military to be sent to Ukraine after the conflict.

"19 May 2023","The West once again confirms that it does not need peace between Russia and Ukraine. The first deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Dmitry Novikov, stated this to Izvestia on May 19. Thus, he commented on the words of the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, that peace negotiations on equal terms between Russia and Ukraine should be rejected. “In fact, this is a statement means that we are once again hearing approaches from the West related to ensuring the continuation of the conflict around Ukraine. These approaches clearly expose all the attempts of Western leaders to look like a constructive force that is interested in stopping the bloodshed,” Novikov said. The deputy emphasized that the West itself created this situation, ignoring Russia’s concerns about the threat to its security. “They refused at the end of 2021 from Russia's proposals to ensure its security. They did not hear us, although we repeatedly drew attention to the fact that we consider the expansion of the NATO bloc and the strengthening of NATO bases near our border a direct threat to our security. Russia had to independently ensure its security in the area of Donetsk and Lugansk,” he said. Novikov said that by making such statements, the West “lowers the barrier to any opportunity to conduct a negotiation process.” “The West is actually fixing a simple thing - the principle of parity in diplomacy in in this case will not work, and if it does not work, then negotiations are not needed at all. Anyone who is at least a little familiar with the practice, traditions, and conditions of international relations and negotiation processes immediately understands that they are lowering the barrier to any opportunity to conduct a negotiation process. Why is this being done along with statements about the need to achieve peace? Then, so that this peace will never be achieved,” he concluded. Magnificent six: African countries will send negotiators to Russia How the continent's states plan to reconcile Moscow and Kyiv On May 18, the Financial Times, citing a European official, reported that G7 leaders will discuss a proposal to hold a peace summit on Ukraine during a three-day meeting in Hiroshima in response to a request Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky. At the same time, Federation Council Senator Sergei Tsekov, in a conversation with Izvestia, noted that Zelensky benefits from the conflict on the territory of his country, and all his peace initiatives are just appearances. A special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by the Russian President announced February 24, 2022, ongoing. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"18 April 2023","All secret Pentagon data that has been leaked to the public is reliable. This statement was made by Deputy Head of the British Ministry of Defense James Heappie on April 18 during his speech in the House of Commons, broadcast on the website of the country's parliament. “The US Secretary of State, the US Department of Defense and the French Ministry of Defense have already said that not all the leaked information is accurate. Colleagues will be upset, I know, but I will not be able to say which part of this information was inaccurate, since this concerns classified intelligence information,” he said, answering questions from parliamentarians about the leak of classified materials. Database: how reliable is the leak of information from the Pentagon? The appearance of secret documents on the Internet may be an American disinformation campaign. The leak of two large batches of secret Pentagon documents became known on April 7. We are talking about about 100 documents that relate to Kyiv’s combat capabilities, NATO support and the vulnerability of the Ukrainian army. The materials leaked onto the Internet also showed that the United States was listening in on South Korea, Israel and Ukraine. Against this backdrop, several countries demanded an explanation from the American side. Later, US President Joe Biden instructed the head of American national intelligence, Avril Haines, to assess the damage allegedly caused by the leak of data from the Pentagon, and the country's Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered a comprehensive review of the Pentagon's security programs, including aspects related to information security. The Washington Post, citing its sources in European governments, wrote that US allies also expressed concern about Washington’s ability to store secret data after the incident with the leak of the Pentagon documents on the Internet. According to sources, information about US spying on allies and partners is not as shocking as before, since many countries are spying on each other. On April 15, Republican Congressman from Texas Tony Gonzalez said that the US authorities had weak control over classified government data.

"12 May 2023","Britain, by transferring long-range Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine, could take the Ukrainian conflict to a fundamentally new level in terms of human casualties and destruction, which will only increase the escalation in the special military operation (SVO) zone. This is stated in a statement issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry on May 12. The Foreign Ministry emphasized that Moscow regards this decision as extremely hostile actions by London aimed at further pumping up Ukraine with weapons. Responsibility for their consequences lies entirely “with the authors and executors of this reckless step,” the department added. “The Russian side reserves the right to take all necessary measures to neutralize the threats that may arise as a result of Ukraine’s use of British cruise missiles,” they emphasized at the Foreign Ministry. They also noted that the transfer of high-precision missile systems to Kyiv confirms the “unprecedented level of involvement” of Great Britain in the conflict in Ukraine. Four X's: what missiles do Russian pilots use in the Northern Military District zone High-precision aircraft munitions have proven their effectiveness during combat operations On the eve of May 11, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace confirmed the supply of Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine. They belong to the air-to-ground class, the range of these weapons is more than 250 km. According to Wallace, the missiles are being delivered or are already in Ukraine. The minister added that the missiles are compatible with the aircraft that Ukraine has. He also acknowledged that the range of Storm Shadows is not in the same league as Russian missile systems - some Russian weapons can operate over much longer distances. Britain's decision on Storm Shadow was supported in the United States. At the same time, on May 9, the Politico newspaper reported that the United States does not plan to send long-range ATACMS missiles to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU). Washington continues to supply Kyiv with Patriot systems, ammunition and armored vehicles. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to hold it was announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to increased shelling by Ukrainian troops.

White House Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby told CNN about this on Wednesday, March 15, amid a discussion of the incident with an American drone in the Black Sea. “The thing we least want, the last thing anyone would want, is escalating the conflict in Ukraine to the point of becoming something between the United States and Russia,” Kirby emphasized. What was sown: how the American Reaper UAV ended up at the bottom of the Black Sea The MQ-9 Reaper drone is dangerously close to the shores of Crimea The incident with the Russian Su-27 fighter and the American MQ-9 drone was reported on March 14 by the European Command of the US Armed Forces (USEUCOM).

According to him, the American Department of Defense decided that Abrams M1A1 tanks would be sent to Kyiv instead of M1A2. Raise supplies: will Kyiv receive weapons for a counter-offensive? The 11th meeting of the contact group on Ukraine was held in Germany at the American Ramstein base. He added that the United States has already transported several units of this equipment to the combat area so that the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) could study their capabilities and use. Prior to this, on April 21, he said that Abrams would arrive in Germany in the coming weeks to train Ukrainian military personnel. Moscow has repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Ukraine. Thus, on January 16, Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov stated that a new round of supplies of more advanced military equipment to Ukraine could “only delay the whole story.” The West has increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which the Russian authorities announced February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of a worsening situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the White House National Security Council, announced this on December 8. “I have no progress to speak of,” he noted, adding that there is still no news on this issue. In addition, , White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who spoke with reporters along with Kirby, said that US President Joe Biden is ready for compromises to approve a budget in the interests of Ukraine. Well, help: American aid to Ukraine will be revised. The form of support and its content will change, and the amounts will become smaller. On December 7, it was reported that the bill to provide the next aid package to Ukraine did not pass a vote in the US Senate. Earlier that day, Biden said that Congress should urgently approve a request for funds for Ukraine. At the same time, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said that the United States was committed to long-term military support for Ukraine even in the face of a delay in the allocation of new assistance to Kyiv. Austin noted that he expects Congress to quickly approve the administration's request for $50 billion in additional aid to Kyiv through the US industrial base. In his opinion, most of these funds will return through investments in the American labor market, as well as in the security of the country as a whole. Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk met with Speaker of the US House of Representatives Mike Johnson on December 6 to discuss the allocation of a new package of military assistance to Kyiv. According to the speaker, he drew Johnson’s attention to the connection between the situation at the front and the supply of weapons to Kiev. On December 5, CNN political commentator Stephen Collinson noted that the unsuccessful counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine called into question the further funding of the country from the United States, since billions of dollars are being sent to assist Ukraine American taxpayers.

The previous two political crises in Ukraine, called “Maidan,” took place in 2004 and 2013–2014. During them, the country's leadership changed. There will be no breakthrough: Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny spoke about positional struggle. In an essay for a British publication, the Ukrainian general made a number of compliments to Russian weapons. Earlier, on November 6, former CIA analyst Larry Johnson said that Zelensky’s actions could provoke a military coup in the country. He noted that Ukraine sees a lack of interest on the part of the United States, but the Ukrainian leader shows isolation from reality and denies the difficult situation of the army in the combat zone. On November 1, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Valery Zaluzhny said that Ukrainian troops cannot achieve a breakthrough , since the conflict has reached a dead end. Delaying hostilities carries great risks for the army. Afterwards, the AFP agency reported that the Ukrainian Armed Forces military predicted their defeat and complained about the state of affairs. On November 4, the Ukrainian leader did not agree with the opinion of the Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief that the situation in the conflict zone had reached a dead end. Zelensky admitted that the offensive of the Ukrainian army is difficult due to the fact that Russian forces control the skies. On November 7, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Alexey Danilov warned against the presence of defeatist sentiments among the commanders of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and in the governing structures of the state. He explained that people who do not believe in victory have no place in the government and command of the country.

Papperger expressed gratitude to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for €100 billion aimed at modernizing the Bundeswehr, but this amount is not enough for the practical tasks of the armed forces. “This decision to allocate €100 billion was bold, but not enough to bring the Bundeswehr level to a truly well-equipped army.” , noted the head of Rheinmetall. “Deliveries to Ukraine have cleared out the already meager stocks of Bundeswehr equipment” MEP Markus Buchheit - on the scale of military assistance to Kyiv, its accession to NATO and the consequences of sanctions against Russia On July 22, the Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported that the German armed forces are facing serious problems in the field security. As of May 31, almost 70 thousand (69,687) people have not yet undergone security checks. On July 10, in an interview with Izvestia, German MEP Markus Buchheit pointed out that Germany is ill-prepared for the possible negative consequences of prolonging the conflict in Ukraine as both militarily and economically. Over the decades, the Bundeswehr has turned into a structure that today is unable or only partially able to fulfill its main task - to defend the country. On July 5, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz advocated reducing payments to families with children and supported increasing the level of defense spending.

According to the abbot of the Lavra, some of the police are standing in a cordon around the monastery, and another part is inside the Lavra itself. “They behave calmly, quietly. Well, God is their witness,” the Metropolitan noted. There is no faith: why are the Ukrainian authorities blocking access to holy relics? The UOC called the events in the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra an unprecedented restriction of the rights of believers. Earlier that day, the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) appealed to believers with a call to defend the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra by all legal means.21 In March, part of the territory of the Lavra was closed, there was an inspection by a commission of the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine.

Numerous violations were cited as the reasons for this decision, but the essence of the complaint was not disclosed. The head of the Ministry of Culture threatened that security forces would be sent to the monastery in order to resolve the situation. In 2022, the Ukrainian authorities intensified actions directed against the UOC. They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” Thus, in December 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine opened 50 criminal cases against priests of the UOC.

The Ukrainian side is making attempts to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, as this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

According to the press secretary's forecasts, the Kiev counteroffensive is expected in about a month. “Currently, this is the most guarded state secret in Ukraine, when and where the counteroffensive will begin. Experts believe that in about a month Kyiv will decide to launch an offensive, which could be the last chance for victory,” the secretary general said. Inglorious attempts: Ukrainian counterattacks in Artemovsk failed. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and our units liberated several more neighborhoods. On the same day, the United States promised to deliver Abrams tanks to Germany for Ukraine in the coming weeks for training soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). However, on April 16, the military experts from The Financial Times concluded that the Ukrainian counteroffensive is a high-risk affair due to the lack of air supremacy. On April 15, The Washington Post columnist David Ignates said that American politicians doubt a successful counteroffensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces due to a lack of shells and a weak training of military personnel. The American newspaper Politico reported on March 15 about the proposed offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which should begin in May.

"19 February 2023","journalist from the British publication The Times gained access to the underground bunker of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, from where he recorded all his addresses to the nation at the beginning of the conflict. The reporter described the situation there in an article published on February 18 entitled “Inside Zelensky’s military bunker: no light, no sleep and secret passwords.” Flight mission: why did Zelensky go to Europe and will London agree to transfer combat aircraft to Kyiv? As the reporter said, when entering Bankovaya Street, what struck him most was that it was very dark inside the building, since the lights were completely turned off, and therefore he moved around the building ""All curtains are drawn to protect against bomb blasts, and lights are turned off to reduce the risk of the building becoming a target for air attacks or snipers. I assumed that the darkness was a temporary measure, but I was told that this is a permanent feature,” he said. According to the author, Bankovaya, where the residence of the head of state is located, is a concrete block of offices that is surrounded by a steel ring. Between them there are checkpoints with armed guard posts. Access inside is provided only to those who have the necessary documents and a passport. At the same time, soldiers ask pedestrians for secret passwords, which are changed every day: often they are just meaningless phrases. Security officers led the journalist behind one of the checkpoints, inside which is the government area known as the Triangle, where the underground bunker is located. The buildings inside have their windows and doors blocked off with sandbags. “The original plan was to stay underground for a week. But events outside forced him to change. Zelensky and his most senior aides spent the better part of two months living underground,” the correspondent writes. The article also states that those invited to live next to the Ukrainian leader in an underground bunker were required to sign a non-disclosure agreement according to which they not allowed to share any details about the bunker's design, location or amenities. “They weren't even allowed to talk about the food they ate. The team isolated below watched the progress of the conflict from the outside through their iPhones,” the journalist explained. On February 4, former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who acted as a mediator between the leadership of Russia and Ukraine at the beginning of the special operation, said that he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in early March last year during his visit to Moscow. In the conversation, he noted that Ukrainian President Zelensky then asked him to contact the Russian leadership. Bennett indicated that he was aware that Zelensky ""was then hiding in some bunker that no one knew about."" According to the politician, the President of Ukraine was worried about his safety, but the Russian leader made it clear that he was not in danger. Since February 24, Russia has been conducting a special operation to protect Donbass, whose residents refused to recognize the results of the 2014 coup in Ukraine. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by Ukrainian troops.

"12 April 2023","One of the classified Pentagon documents leaked online presents four options for the development of the situation in Ukraine in the event of unforeseen circumstances. The American newspaper The New York Times (NYT) wrote about this on April 11. “Hypothetical scenarios include the death of [Russian and Ukrainian] presidents Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky, removal from leadership of the Russian Armed Forces and a Ukrainian attack on the Kremlin,” the publication says. The possibility of negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine and the use of tactical nuclear weapons as a last resort cannot be ruled out. The publication notes that this document is a fairly typical product created by the intelligence services. It is designed to help U.S. military officials, policymakers, and legislators assess the outcome of major events and consider possible courses of action. In particular, the possibility of a Kyiv strike on Moscow is of great concern to the Joe Biden administration, as this could provoke a sharp escalation on the part of Russia. “The document is marked RELIDO, which indicates that the decision on the disclosure of information - for example, to foreign partners - remains for certain high-ranking officials. It is dated February 24 and marked “One year,” indicating that the analysis was conducted one year after the start of the [special operation],” the authors add. The leak does not work: who benefits from the leaks of American intelligence services The version of disinformation does not stand up to criticism The Russian Foreign Ministry, in turn, did not rule out that leaks of US secret documents could be disinformation that is aimed at misleading Russia. At the same time, as Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergei Ryabkov said on April 12, Moscow has no position on the question of why the leak occurred. In a conversation with Izvestia, retired colonel Viktor Litovkin suggested that in this way the United States is trying abdicate responsibility for the possible failure of the Ukrainian armed forces in the event of an offensive. He noted that Ukraine has neither the forces nor the means for the spring counter-offensive, which was announced last month. The leak of two large batches of secret Pentagon documents became known on April 6. We are talking about about 100 documents that relate to Kyiv’s combat capabilities, NATO support and the vulnerability of the Ukrainian army. It also follows from documents leaked online that the United States is listening in on South Korea, Israel, and Ukraine.

Making friends with eagles: Poland in the focus of American influence in Europe Warsaw wants to shape a new reality in European geopolitics Earlier in the day, the Polish ambassador to France Jan Emeric Rosciszewski said that Warsaw would directly come into conflict with Russia if Ukraine shows its failure on the battlefield. According to the diplomat, Kyiv supposedly defends Western values and culture, so victory is necessary. The Polish Embassy in France considered that Roscishevsky’s statement about Warsaw’s readiness to enter into armed confrontation with Moscow was taken out of context and incorrectly interpreted. According to the embassy, he meant only the hypothetical spread of the conflict to other countries of Central Europe, but otherwise clearly stated that “Poland is not in a state of war, but is doing everything to help Ukraine defend itself.” In turn, the Russian senator Alexey Pushkov called the statement of the Polish ambassador about entering into the Ukrainian conflict in the event of a defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) presumptuous.

"12 November 2023","The conflict in Ukraine is approaching the moment when Kyiv will have to start negotiating with Moscow and make territorial concessions. Robbie Soave, the host of the American political show Rising on The Hill TV, expressed this opinion on November 11. “We knew we would find ourselves in this situation. A situation in which Russia and Ukraine need to negotiate and [in which] both sides will have to make concessions. Ukraine may have to make territorial concessions,” Soave said. There will be no breakthrough: Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny spoke about positional struggle In an essay for a British publication, the Ukrainian general made a number of compliments to Russian weapons. On November 9, it was reported that the United States predicted early negotiations on Ukraine due to pressure on the country’s President Vladimir Zelensky. Responsible Statecraft columnist Ted Snyder said that, in his opinion, in addition to pressure coming from within the Ukrainian leader’s domestic political and military circle, diplomatic pressure also comes from leading international partners, so Ukraine will be forced to negotiate with Russia. Special operation to protect Donbass, about the beginning of which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24 last year continues.

"March 2024","Employees of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) came with searches to the supernumerary priest of the Cherkasy diocese of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) Boris Brodovsky. This was announced on March 5 by the head of the legal department of the diocese, Archpriest Georgy Pogranichny, whose words are quoted by the website of the Union of Orthodox Journalists (UOJ). He said that SBU officers broke into the priest’s house early in the morning, where they began searches. The head of the diocese’s legal department admitted that this may be due to the fact that the priest allegedly reposted a video on social networks “justifying Russian aggression.” “We tried to get in touch with him, but we can’t get through to him. Apparently, SBU officers confiscated Boris’s father’s phone. We are already going there, we will clarify the situation,” added Archpriest Georgy Pogranichny. Crisis of faith: why they started banning the UOC in Ukraine The Verkhovna Rada supported the bill in the first reading In February, in the Dnepropetrovsk region, the rector of a church of the canonical UOC was sentenced to five years in prison. The SBU claims that he supported Russia and called on believers to help it. They clarified that the rector (his name was not given) during his sermons spoke out in support of the special operation, and during personal conversations with parishioners he advised them to go to new regions of the Russian Federation and help the Russians there. Earlier, on May 11, 2023, a court in the Ukrainian Kirovograd sentenced the former ruling bishop of the Kirovograd diocese of the canonical UOC, Metropolitan Joasaph (Peter Guben) and the secretary of the diocese Roman Kondratyuk to three years in prison. They were accused of inciting religious hatred, supporting the reunification of Crimea with Russia, and distributing “hostile” literature. In 2022, the Ukrainian authorities intensified actions directed against the UOC. They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” In December 2022, the SBU opened 50 criminal cases against priests of the UOC.

"June 2023","In Ukraine, the number of people dissatisfied with the rule of the country's President Vladimir Zelensky is growing. This was stated by former adviser to ex-President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin. “An internal front is being built against Zelensky, because everyone is already tired of him,” Soskin said on his YouTube channel. According to him, the people of Ukraine are dissatisfied with the president’s authoritarianism, as well as incompetence government of the country. As Soskin himself believes, Zelensky, “having violated the Constitution of Ukraine, turned into a military dictator-ruler.” The political scientist also suggested that Zelensky could enter into confrontation with the mayor of Kyiv Vitaliy Klitschko in the struggle for power in the country. Black crow of the crisis: Zelensky completes the sale of Ukraine The country is coming under the control of transnational financial elites Earlier, on May 7, the ex-chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) Marat Bashirov noted that all sociological surveys that are currently conducted in Ukraine about the trust of the population Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, do not correspond to reality. According to him, the people hate Zelensky. It is possible to learn about this from open sources only if free media appears in Ukraine. However, on April 11, Soskin already pointed out Zelensky’s failed domestic policy. According to him, the Ukrainian president will be forced to resign if he does not change his course.

"July 2023","The position of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the issue of Kyiv joining NATO became one of the reasons for the conflict in Ukraine, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said on Saturday, June 1, in an interview with Bild. “Do not repeat the mistake that Chancellor Merkel made in Bucharest in 2008, when she resolutely opposed any steps towards Ukraine’s membership in NATO,” he said. The decision of the ex-chancellor led to the reunification of Crimea with Russia, and also allegedly became one of the causes of the conflict in Donbass, Kuleba said. Europe will be able to avoid a conflict with Russia in the future only if Ukraine becomes a member of the alliance, he believes. “Not accepting Ukraine into NATO after the <conflict> would be suicide for Europe,” Kuleba said. This is not NATO for anyone: the alliance will not give Ukraine security guarantees. What are the prospects for Kyiv joining the bloc? Earlier, on June 28, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance at the summit in Vilnius, which will take place on July 11–12, will strengthen political ties with Ukraine and agree on multi-year aid package that will bring the country closer to its rightful place in NATO. Earlier that day, the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Alexey Reznikov, said that Ukraine’s admission to NATO during active hostilities is unlikely. However, he called the experience of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) using Western weapons against the Russian army as a weighty argument. President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky noted on June 27 that there are reasons for inviting the country to NATO, but did not name them. At the same time, the Ukrainian leader emphasized that he has a full understanding of the country’s security guarantees until joining the alliance. On September 30, 2022, Ukraine submitted an application to join NATO on an accelerated basis. Then Zelensky said that in fact Ukraine is already in NATO and meets the standards of the alliance.

"January 21 2024","The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will have to leave a bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Dnieper near the village of Krynki. A Ukrainian soldier stated this on January 19 in an interview with the Financial Times. As the militant pointed out, the units located on the bridgehead are suffering heavy losses. At the same time, the Russian army has an advantage in manpower. The situation on the bridgehead is assessed as deplorable. However, when the Ukrainian Armed Forces can leave the bridgehead is not specified. Positions and sacrifices: the president assessed the actions of the Ukrainians in Krynki Kyiv is losing elite units in attempts to hold a bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnieper Meanwhile, on January 20, journalist Christoph Wanner announced the tactical successes of the Russian Federation in the village of Krynki, Kherson region. On January 18, the governor of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said that The Ukrainian Armed Forces are building defensive structures and are gradually moving to strategic defense on the right bank of the Dnieper. According to him, attempts by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to carry out active actions against the Armed Forces of Russia can be seen at present and in the situation in the village of Krynki on the left bank of the Dnieper. Representative of the operational command “South” of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Natalya Gumenyuk said on January 16 that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Ukrainian units fight back against the Russian military in the village of Krynki on the left bank of the Dnieper in the Kherson region. According to her, at present, soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces continue to deliver powerful attacks on the positions of the Ukrainian army. On December 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin, during the “Results of the Year,” spoke about the situation in Krynki on the left bank of the Dnieper. The head of state pointed out that Kyiv is losing not just military personnel, but the elite - the assault troops. According to him, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are “pushing people to be exterminated” in Krynki, and the Ukrainian servicemen themselves say that “this is a one-way road.” This is stupid and irresponsible, the president believes. At the same time, he added that Russia’s losses there are sanitary, and it is beneficial for the Russian Army that the Armed Forces of Ukraine send their soldiers there. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

"November 2023","The United States, without an official announcement, transferred one, or perhaps several Assault Breachers armored vehicles to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU). Forbes reported this on Friday, November 3. “The Assault Breacher, or ABV, is one of the most secure and versatile breaching vehicles. A couple of machines can do the same job that would require four, five or six less versatile machines, such as sappers, bulldozers and excavators,” says columnist David Ax. Ax claims that Ukraine could receive from one to six such armored vehicles. According to the observer, the equipment appeared in photographs on the website of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, taken on the Day of the Missile Forces and Artillery of Ukraine, which is celebrated on November 3. At the same time, ABV, according to him, was absent from the official lists of US military assistance. “Recently, the enemy’s actions have been more passive.” Heavy fighting is taking place in the north of Donetsk - the Russian Armed Forces are repelling the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attempts to storm the villages of Opytnoye and Spartak. Earlier, on November 3, military expert, retired colonel Anatoly Matviychuk listed the main complaints of the Ukrainian Armed Forces against weapons supplied by the West . He named one of them as the equipment’s unsuitability for the European theater of military operations. He noted that the same American Abrams tanks cannot even climb the ice hill, as the clutch slips. Before this, on October 19, the United States admitted that the Ukrainian counteroffensive was completed. Changes in weather and proximity to winter do not leave the Ukrainian Armed Forces a chance to achieve their goals this year. Earlier, on October 17, reserve captain 1st rank Vasily Dandykin explained that the main advantage of the Russian army in winter is equipment adapted for such harsh weather conditions. The Armed Forces of Ukraine received their tanks and other weapons from the West, where the climate is completely different. On October 13, it became known that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and his Western allies were concerned about the active preparation of the Russian Armed Forces for the continuation of the special operation in the coming winter. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"March 4 2024","The number of conscientious objectors in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) has increased fivefold. This statement was made by former Prime Minister Mykola Azarov on March 4. “The number of Ukrainian men who refuse to face certain death for the regime of [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky has increased fivefold. The number of military personnel who chose to desert but save their lives has also increased,” says his message published on Facebook (belongs to Meta, recognized as extremist in the Russian Federation). The politician also said that Kyiv is sorely lacking in human resources capable of managing and serving weapons received from Western countries. As Azarov noted, Western supporters can transfer ammunition, but the Armed Forces of Ukraine have fewer and fewer personnel left. “Next there will be an explosion”: riots against mobilization began in Ukraine. Military commissars were opposed in the Carpathian region and the Dnieper. Earlier that day, captured soldier Sergei Good of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that medical examinations for joining the army are formal. Thus, citizens with various diseases become military personnel. At the same time, he clarified that after a medical examination, all age categories of soldiers were sent to serve, including those over 50 years old. Prior to this, on March 1, Ukrainian Armed Forces military officer Yevgeny Lebed said that he was sent to the front line, despite health problems under the threat of initiating a criminal case for refusing to go to war. The soldier emphasized that he was glad to be alive and called on Ukrainians to avoid mobilization by any possible means. On the same day, residents of Kyiv held a protest rally near the building of the military registration and enlistment office in the Dnepropetrovsk district of the city. Protestants demanded that the country's authorities change the conditions of mobilization and rotate military personnel at the front. Journalist David Patrikarakos, in an article for the British newspaper Daily Mail on February 29, reported that “gangs of forced recruitment” into the army are operating in Ukraine. According to him, recruiters are forcibly taking to the front “unwilling and insufficiently prepared” Ukrainians who are unable to pay off with bribes. Martial law in Ukraine has been in effect since February 2022. At the same time, Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization. Later, the Verkhovna Rada repeatedly extended its validity.

"26 May 2023","The United States is greatly mistaken in believing that its self-preservation is ensured by the Atlantic Ocean. This statement was made by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the program “Moscow. Kremlin. Putin"" TV channel ""Russia 1"". A fragment of the interview was published on May 26 in the Telegram channel of journalist Pavel Zarubin. “Washington believes that its self-preservation is ensured by the Atlantic Ocean, this is also a strong delusion if they are trying to bring the world to the brink of a third world war,” Lavrov said, commenting on the escalation from -for the promised supply of F-16 fighters to Kiev. The minister added that for now the United States is “inciting its European satellites to Russia,” believing that they can get away with anything. No runway: The United States will continue consultations on the supply of F-16s to Kyiv Russia called the West's plans to send fighters to Ukraine a move towards escalation. The day before, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergei Ryabkov said that F-16 fighters would become a legitimate target for Russia if the West supplies them to Ukraine for combat in the special operation zone. On May 23, the Pentagon noted that deliveries of F-16s to Ukraine would be carried out in the long term. On the same day, military expert Alexey Leonkov said that it would take at least a year and a half to train Ukrainian pilots to operate F-16 fighters.21 May US President Joe Biden said that he outlined to Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky the plans of Western countries to train pilots to fly the F-16 and other military aircraft. Zelensky in response thanked Biden for the financial assistance provided to Kyiv, which already amounted to $37 billion, and for a new package of military equipment.

"21 September 2023","Chairman of the “We are together with Russia” movement Vladimir Rogov, commenting on the conditions of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky for the establishment of peace, suggested that the country return to the borders of 1991, joining the Russian Federation as a new district. “Zelensky is talking about the borders of 1991. I agree, it’s time for Ukraine to return to those borders, but only when it was part of the Soviet Union. Taking into account the new realities, a federal district within the Russian Federation may well emerge after the liberation of the entire post-Ukrainian space from the power of the Nazis,” he said on Thursday, September 21, in an interview with RIA Novosti. According to the chairman of the movement, the President of Ukraine, sharing the conditions to end the conflict, failed to “renew the repertoire” for the UN. Rogov added that Zelensky has repeated this agenda many times, but the politician, “as a performer, should know for certain that no one watches concerts that have been overplayed, and they don’t buy tickets for them.” “The Kiev regime has done a lot of things that will attract an international tribunal” Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov - about the possibility of negotiations with Ukraine, the change of elites and the presidential elections of 2024 On September 20, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky during his speech at a meeting of the UN Security Council on situation in the country, he named two conditions under which the fighting would end. Later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov commented on Zelensky’s words, pointing out that after the West’s calls to return to the 1991 borders, the question arises whether people are familiar with the plans of the Ukrainian authorities. September 18 Zelensky said that Kyiv does not plan to meet Moscow’s territorial conditions in order to end the conflict. The president did not answer the question about the similar status of Crimea. On September 15, the head of the German Defense Ministry, Boris Pistorius, indicated that the conflict can only be resolved when Kyiv decides to negotiate and seek compromises.

"November 2023","The death of Assistant Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Gennady Chastyakov is embedded in a chain of events that will continue to occur against the backdrop of failures on the battlefield. What happened the day before is a game within the team of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny and the President of the country Vladimir Zelensky, says political strategist, political scientist and psychologist Sergei Markelov. “This will be a chain of events that will continue. This trend is called “playing within a team.” “Everything is bad,” and this means that someone must bear public and internal responsibility for this, that is, hidden responsibility,” he said in an interview with the Zvezda TV channel. According to the political scientist, at the moment the only way for Ukraine solve a problem - remove a person. Markelov believes that there will still be “enough deaths” in the team of Zelensky and Zaluzhny. “There will be deaths. The only way to resolve any uncertainty today. Nobody wants to think. Strange as it may seem, no person, no problem,” the expert said. He added that sometimes it is assistants, rather than superiors, who have more insider information. Chastyakov could have “serious access” to information and even state secrets, he admitted. There will be no breakthrough: Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny spoke about positional struggle.

According to sources of the Ukrainian agency UNN in law enforcement authorities, the death of Zaluzhny’s assistant was probably caused by a gift from Ukrainian Armed Forces Colonel Alexander Timchenko, NSN reports. He has already given evidence, admitting that he decided to give his colleague such a present - he put a bottle of whiskey and six grenades in a wooden box. This information was also confirmed by three witnesses, in whose presence the colonel handed it over.

He noted that prolongation of hostilities carries great risks for the Ukrainian army. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky did not agree with Zaluzhny’s opinion. He admitted that the offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is difficult due to the fact that Russian forces control the skies, but “this is not a stalemate.” At the same time, the deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, Igor Zhovkva, noted that Zaluzhny’s statement was inappropriate and caused panic among the leadership of Western countries.

"February 2024","US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland visited Kyiv due to Washington's concerns regarding the conflict between the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valery Zaluzhny and the country's President Vladimir Zelensky. Political scientist Ivan Mezyukho expressed this opinion in a conversation with Izvestia on February 5. Earlier on Monday, the Asia Times newspaper explained Nuland’s visit to Kyiv last week with the threat of a military coup in Ukraine. The publication's columnist Stephen Bryan suggested that the coup could have been carried out by the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valery Zaluzhny, due to a disagreement with the country's president. “This visit can be characterized as a kind of US diplomatic intelligence of the situation that has developed within the Ukrainian political establishment, but in my opinion, we are clearly not talking about a coup d’etat . Probably, Washington and the structures responsible for Ukraine, similar to the American State Department, are concerned about the tension in the relationship between the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny and the country’s President Vladimir Zelensky. Most likely, Victoria Nuland resolved issues related to the complexity of their communication,” says Mezyukho. Ukrainian Armed Forces are bad: Zelensky is losing popularity and eliminating competitors The President of Ukraine, amid falling ratings, took on Zaluzhny Earlier, on February 4, ex-CIA officer Larry Johnson, in an interview with the YouTube channel Dialogue Works, shared his opinion that the United States is currently supporting Zelensky in the conflict with Zaluzhny . He noted that Zaluzhny has already become more popular than Zelensky, which raises concerns among the latter. Prior to this, on February 2, Ukrainian media reported that Nuland’s visit to Kyiv was a surprise. The official schedule published by the US State Department did not say anything about coming to Ukraine. Nuland arrived in Kyiv on January 31. During the visit, she met with leaders of the Ukrainian government, veterans and the public. The split between the President of Ukraine and the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine began to be discussed after November 1, 2023, when Zaluzhny, in an interview for The Economist magazine, said that Ukrainian troops could not achieve a breakthrough, since the conflict has reached a dead end. Prolongation of hostilities carries great risks for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, he noted. Zelensky did not agree with the opinion of the commander in chief.

This is cooperation on military materials - our contribution to the Ukrainian army. Secondly, this is the training of Ukrainian soldiers,” TASS quotes a statement to journalists in Brussels. The EU also noted that the community intends to consider how to further integrate the Ukrainian defense industry into the European one. Plus, helping to combat misinformation and provide cybersecurity assistance is “all part of the package,” the spokesman added. Reuters indicated that European leaders had concluded ahead of the summit that providing financial assistance to Ukraine at this time was also is ""existential"". The EU representative noted that at least 26 members of the community, against the backdrop of the fact that the authorities of Hungary and Slovakia refused to support Ukraine, in particular, will continue to help the country. A group of strange ones: at what point will the EU start saving in Ukraine And at whose expense is the association trying to increase military assistance to Kiev? Earlier, on December 7, scientists from the leading classical university and research center in Germany - Kiel University - calculated that the volume of military, financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine from on the Western side from August to October fell by almost 90% compared to the same period in 2022. Over the past three months, of the 42 states offering assistance to Kyiv, only 20 have committed to providing new aid packages, they said. Prior to this, on December 4, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who opposes arms supplies to Ukraine, said that in a conversation with his Ukrainian colleague Denis Shmygal, he ruled out the supply of weapons from state warehouses and warehouses of the Slovak army. On December 1, Reuters, citing a source, reported that it would be difficult for EU leaders at the community summit to be held on December 14–15 to reach agreement on the issue of providing €50 billion to Ukraine. Before this, it was reported that European countries plan to begin transferring F-16 fighters to Kyiv in the first quarter of 2024. At this time, Ukraine hopes to receive 19 aircraft from Denmark. Subsequently, the Netherlands and Belgium also promised to supply aircraft to Kyiv.

"July 2023","Kyiv and its minions, oppressing the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), are grossly violating their own legislation. This statement was made on Thursday, July 6, by the special representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry for cooperation in the field of respect for the right to freedom of religion, Gennady Askaldovich. He indicated that the believers and clergy of the UOC are currently under severe pressure. In particular, they are openly threatened with physical violence, Askaldovich added. “The reason is the alleged affiliation of the UOC with the Moscow Patriarchate.

He emphasized that it is still not among the priorities of UN staff and other relevant organizations. “At the same time, the voices of numerous representatives of religious and civil circles about support for the UOC and solidarity with it continue to sound louder. However, the Ukrainian authorities stubbornly do not want to hear them and continue their criminal policy,” added the special representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” Thus, in December 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) opened 50 criminal cases against priests of the UOC.

"January 2024","The opposition in Germany demanded the return of Ukrainian refugees to their homeland due to high losses on the part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). The German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) writes about this. “They are missing not only at the front, where signs of fatigue are becoming noticeable, but also in civil defense and the Ministry of Emergency Situations,” says the article dated December 29. The article notes that Germany allocates more funds to provide for refugees from Ukraine evading service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine than it spends on training and equipping Ukrainian military personnel. “Almost €3 billion was allocated from the federal budget to pay benefits for Ukrainian refugees. For comparison, all military aid to Ukraine amounted to € 5.4 billion,” the newspaper clarified. At the same time, according to FAZ, immediately after the start of the conflict, the share of adult men among the total number of refugees was 7%, but by September 2023 it reached 28%. Hole on the border: Kyiv intends to conscript Ukrainian refugees into the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Ukrainian authorities are looking for ways to return men liable for military service from Europe On December 30, former head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs Yuriy Lutsenko said that the situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front is currently critical. According to him, the Ukrainian army is experiencing the most difficult period since the beginning of the conflict. At the same time, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, even in difficult conditions, “thinks only about his ratings,” Lutsenko added. On December 23, Focus magazine chief correspondent Ulrich Reitz said that the return of citizens of military age to Ukraine would be in the interests of Germany. According to him, fewer Ukrainians work in Germany than in other countries, since they use benefits. On December 22, the idea of mobilizing the citizens of Ukraine who left was supported by Roderich Kiesewetter, a member of the Bundestag from the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party. In his opinion, Germany should not “encourage those who shy away from the desire to help their homeland.” However, German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann said that Berlin would not hand over Ukrainians evading conscription to Kyiv. On December 19, Zelensky, during a press conference, spoke about the military’s proposal to conscript about 500 thousand more people due to failures at the front. He did not confirm the exact figure, since there is no understanding in the country on the issue of military rotations and leaves for active military personnel. The President of Ukraine signed a decree on general mobilization in February 2022. At the same time, martial law was declared in Ukraine. Most men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which the president announced on February 24, 2022, continues.

In addition, according to the Secretary of State, Kyiv will be provided with anti-tank ammunition, missiles, as well as HESCO barriers, which are a modern version of a gabion (a sand-filled fortification) that allows you to quickly build a defense from shelling. “Unless Congress acts to provide additional assistance, this will be one of the last security aid packages we will be able to provide to Ukraine,” Blinken recalled. He also repeated his call for the US Congress to continue supporting the Kyiv side of the conflict. The coveted dose: the United States decided not to rush to help Ukraine Zelensky personally flew to Washington for weapons and money, but there is almost no chance of getting them. Earlier that day, US President Joe Biden, during a press conference following a meeting with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, said that Washington is rapidly approaching the loss of its ability to provide further assistance to Kiev. Before this, Biden, following a meeting with Zelensky, approved the allocation of another package of military assistance to Kyiv in the amount of $200 million. On December 12, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova mentioned Blinken’s statement that about 90% of financial military assistance to Kyiv remained in the United States. She emphasized that the statement of the American diplomat is not only misleading, but also confirms that for Washington, “Ukraine is an opportunity to line its pockets.” At the end of October, the Pentagon reported that the total amount of US military support to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) during its work American President Joe Biden's presidency exceeded $44.5 billion, and since the beginning of the Russian special military operation - $43.9 billion.

"October 2 2023","EU foreign ministers will discuss increasing pressure on Russia and further assistance to Ukraine during an informal meeting in Kyiv. Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot wrote about this on the social network X (formerly Twitter) on October 2. “We will discuss how the EU can further increase pressure on Russia, and all possible ways to support Ukraine - now and in the future,” the senior official said diplomat. Slot also thanked the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Dmitry Kuleba for the invitation to the event. Such a meeting will be held in Kyiv for the first time, she noted. As Gazeta.Ru writes, the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, announced an informal meeting of the Council of the Foreign Ministries of the European Union on October 2 in Kyiv.

According to him, the European Parliament has been “fooling” Kyiv for at least 15 years.

"24 October 2023","Bulgaria, Hungary and Greece may be the first to refuse support for Ukraine. Poland would also like to give it up, but is now under pressure from the United States. Political scientist Dmitry Zhuravlev said this on Tuesday, October 24. “Ukraine did not recognize the Ukrainian Hungarians as a separate people with the right to autonomy, so the country was very offended. The Poles also have a crisis in their relations. They actively supported Ukraine, but now there are contradictions. Poland would like to stop the assistance, but the United States is putting pressure on it,” he said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. According to the political scientist, if the support of the first three countries is not so significant, since these are rather poor states with small arsenals, then the cessation of assistance from Poland could become critical. “Almost all military equipment repair systems are located on Polish territory, so this country is very important, because of this the United States is putting pressure on it. US President Joe Biden, in turn, will emphasize the need to support Ukraine to the last,” Zhuravlev said, admitting that if his rival Donald Trump wins the election, he could completely cut off all aid. Not a priority: the United States has begun to lose interest in Ukraine Against the backdrop of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Washington reported that the possibilities of supplying weapons to Kyiv are not unlimited. Earlier, on October 23, University of Mississippi professor Joseph Atkins said that Western countries were making a big mistake by continuing to provide assistance to the Ukrainian authorities. In his opinion, the continuation of the Ukrainian conflict only leads to new deaths, and the Kyiv regime still cannot win, reports the 360 TV channel. On October 20, President Biden asked the US Congress to provide additional military and other assistance to Ukraine and Israel in the amount of about $106 billion, of which more than $60 billion is intended for Kyiv. On the same day, Assistant to the US President for National Security Jake Sullivan notified that the country's federal budget had almost run out of money that the United States could afford to spend to support Ukraine. Later, on October 22, it became known that most of the funds from $61.4 billion that Biden requested from the US Congress for Ukraine will be allocated to the military needs of the United States. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 by Russian leader Vladimir Putin after the situation worsened in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

Maria Lvova-Belova, Commissioner for Children's Rights under the President of the Russian Federation, told Izvestia about this on December 5. “Today the reunification has already taken place. Now families with children are waiting for the journey home. In fact, these are different stories, different regions, and they are connected, one might say, with family disputes in the current situation. For example, there were several children with grandmothers or two girls with fathers, and mothers are in Ukraine. All the children were with one of their relatives, but now reunification is happening mainly with their mothers,” she emphasized. Six Ukrainian children who were in the new regions were returned to their mothers. Their meeting took place at the Qatari embassy in Moscow - Qatar acted as a mediator in negotiations between Moscow and Kiev on family reunification. “We are actively participating in the reunification. But at the same time, unfortunately, from the Ukrainian side we constantly hear accusations that we do not hand over children. Or those situations in which we actively participated, but then it was presented in such a way that it happened on its own, without our help. That’s why the embassy here (of Qatar. - Ed.) helps us a lot in planning and assistance in the process, and, as always, as a third party, an independent one, which records,” Lvova-Belova noted. According to her, the Russian side continues to plan return children to the territory of Ukraine. “We regularly work on several stories in which we help. Naturally, there are still children who are in Ukraine and whom we plan to return to Russia. But these are also family stories: the parents are here, and the children and their grandmother are in Ukraine. That's why we work on it regularly. “Depending on the situation, on the elaboration of specific stories,” said Lvova-Belova. She pointed out that the reunification of some families is difficult in various aspects. “Because it does not always turn out to be as stated - for example, one of the parents is not ready to return the child, they need to negotiate, mediate, which will improve relations between the parents before handing over the children. Sometimes children refuse to return, and here we also have to resort to the help of psychologists who work <...> We take each story into consideration and help, because the President (of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin - Ed.) very specifically said that if there are parents or relatives and the child wants, then we must participate so that families are reunited again,” Lvova-Belova noted.

"26 July 2023","Responsibility for the failure of the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) lies with the NATO countries, which postponed the deadline and failed to prepare the Ukrainian military. Newsweek reported this on Wednesday, July 26, citing Western experts. “Although there are many reasons for this relative failure, including the strength of the Russian defense, some experts also point to a less obvious reason: NATO,” the publication writes. that the alliance pushed back the timing of the start of the Ukrainian Armed Forces offensive, “the time frame for the summer counter-offensive was set based on the NATO schedule, not Ukraine,” says military analyst Allan Orr. Research fellow at the University of Bologna Nicolo Fasola expressed the opinion that the West underestimated the importance of the training process for a successful counter-offensive . According to him, the West was too focused on the technological side of the strategy, providing Kyiv with weapons, while not having enough time to “properly train the Ukrainian military.” Lethal tactics: The Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to break into Russian defenses with infantry. Why did the armed formations change tactics and how long can attacks last without the use of armored vehicles? Earlier that day, a military expert with the Austrian Ministry of Defense, Colonel Markus Reisner, said that the significant losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were due to the inexperience of the officers. He also believes that the first phase of the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian troops ended in failure. Prior to this, on July 24, military expert Franz-Stefan Gadi also indicated that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were suffering setbacks during the offensive due to poor organization of the entire operation. In his opinion, the command is to blame for the problems of the Ukrainian troops.

He noted that theoretically, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) could hit Russian missile carriers only with the help of the old Soviet anti-aircraft missile system (SAM) S-200, but only if a number of conditions are met. “The problem for Ukrainian air defense commanders is that all Russian bombers launch cruise missiles, the range of which can exceed 200 miles (321 km - Ed.). A typical Tu-22M3 Kh-22/32 strike missile has a range of more than 500 miles (804 km - Ed.),” recalled Ex. He added that the S-200 hits targets only at a distance of about 300 km According to the journalist, the Ukrainian S-200 could hit this bomber only if it flew close enough to it or if the battery itself was far ahead.

"26 February 2023","Despite a long-term commitment to the policy of non-interference and external neutrality, after the start of Russia’s special military operation (SVO) to protect Donbass, Switzerland decided to support Kyiv. This position was voiced by official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova on February 26 in her Telegram channel. Neutral odes: Switzerland and Austria thought about their status What awaits the concept of non-alignment with military blocs of a number of countries in Europe As examples of Switzerland’s departure from the policy of neutrality, she listed a number of episodes that indicate support for Kyiv. In particular, Bern officially condemned the SVO, supported EU sanctions, blocked the accounts of a number of individuals and legal entities from the Russian Federation, and also banned the provision of services to the Russian government. In addition, as Zakharova noted, Bern actively trains soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) and sends humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and is also involved in facilitating migration procedures for Ukrainian refugees and initiating the provision of financial assistance to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. “And there is a lot more that Bern does not consider a departure from neutrality, but logic suggests the opposite,” summed up the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Earlier, on February 25, Zakharova stated that Switzerland cannot be a mediator in negotiations on the Ukrainian crisis and provide its platform due to the fact that it has already joined sanctions against the Russian Federation. She also emphasized that by his decree of September 30, 2022, Zelensky legally prohibited negotiations with the Russian leadership. Prior to this, on February 23, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said that negotiations were being held in Geneva on the situation in Ukraine.

Responding to criticism from the former British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace that Germany is “heavily penetrated by Russian intelligence” and is “neither safe nor calm,” the diplomat called his words “extremely unhelpful.” In addition, Berger accused Russia of publishing the call and called on the allies to focus on supplying Ukraine with sufficient amount of ammunition. “Scholz will have to remove Pistorius from office” Bundestag deputy Herold Otten - about the scandal in the Bundeswehr, the arms lobby in Germany and the conflict between the Russian Federation and NATO On March 1, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion of senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, which, according to her, took place on February 19.

The Ukrainian side is making attempts to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, as this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"24 March 2023","The EU certainly wants to influence China's position towards Russia, but this cannot be done through travel and negotiations. Federation Council Senator Sergei Tsekov told Izvestia about this on March 24. In this way, he responded to the words of French leader Emmanuel Macron that France and Germany would try to strengthen interaction with Beijing in order to influence the Russian Federation on the situation around Ukraine. This is how Macron explained the goals of his upcoming April trip to China. He also noted that during his visit to China he will be accompanied by the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. “Of course, they want China to be their ally. France, especially the European Commission, expresses the general line of the European Union, which is dictated by the United States of America. They are, of course, concerned that China is pursuing an independent policy, that China is friendly with Russia. They will try to change this somehow, but I think they are very naive if they think that they can change something during a trip,” Tsekov said. The senator expressed the opinion that if European countries want to change world politics, then first of all, they need to change themselves. “They themselves must pursue an adequate international policy, which is that there is no need to impose on anyone their vision of how this or that state should live, how it should cooperate with other states. If they demonstrate complete respect for other states, then world politics will change. And to change it through a trip, through some conversations - this is basically impossible in the current situation,” Tsekov concluded. “Russia will be forced to react” Putin spoke about the supply of ammunition to Kyiv, assessed the PRC peace plan and held negotiations with Xi Earlier, on March 21, Chinese President Xi Jinping, following negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, said that China stands for peace and dialogue on the Ukrainian conflict. He also emphasized that in this matter, the PRC is guided by the principles of the UN Charter and adheres to an objective and impartial position, and also actively promotes reconciliation and restoration of negotiations. On the same day, Putin allowed the adoption of the Chinese peace plan, but noted that Russia and China oppose to ensure that any states and blocs cause damage to third countries. At the end of February, China presented its plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. Beijing called on all sides to stop fighting, “abandon the Cold War mentality” and begin peace talks.

"27 March 2023","Many Western countries have enough fighter jets to supply Ukraine, but the country lacks the infrastructure necessary for the aircraft, since most of the airfields are out of service, which makes the very fact of their transfer meaningless. Military expert, retired colonel Viktor Litovkin said this on Monday, March 27. “In addition to the airfield, we need a command tower, radars that will accompany flights, technical and operational units - these are small factories at airfields, hangars. And there is a lot of other infrastructure necessary for the plane to take off and return,” he said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. According to him, the necessary infrastructure to replace the destroyed one cannot be created in a week or a month. The fighters will have to take off from Romania, Poland and Slovakia. At the same time, the skies are under Russian control, so any plane taking off from these countries will be shot down. “The plane is difficult to hide. He rises into the air, we see him. Moreover, Ukraine’s planes are old and there are no new ones. There are also not enough pilots,” Litovkin noted. Elusive fighters: NATO countries did not promise planes to Kyiv How the ninth meeting in the Ramstein format ended Earlier that day, Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland Pawel Jablonski said that the republic would not give Ukraine all its MiG-29 fighters.

Johnson (former British Prime Minister - Ed.) came out and said when he visited [Ukraine] in the spring of 2022 that you must fight until the last Ukrainian. He arrived and gave the command to stop negotiations. I am sure that this is the opinion not so much of Johnson as of the Americans,” Azarov said.

We are talking, in particular, about Javelin anti-tank systems and Stinger anti-aircraft systems, writes Gazeta.Ru. It is assumed that the Iranian military will disassemble the weapons, study them, and then create analogues. However, according to American officials, the problem is not systematic, but the Pentagon admits that all weapons transferred to Kyiv are difficult to track. According to CNN journalists, Iran has extensive experience in developing weapons systems based on American models. An overseas guest: the head of the Pentagon has arrived in the Middle East.

Russia was not able to capture a single village, not a single Ukrainian village during this year,” he insisted on American television. Zelensky rejected criticism and accusations that he was trying to consolidate power during the conflict. He continued to assert that the Russian government is the “only enemy” and that the commanders and soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are concerned only with them. Numerous reports from the Russian Ministry of Defense with video and photographic materials indicate that Zelensky’s statements are far from reality and are lies. testimonies of local residents about how the Russian military liberated Ukrainian settlements from nationalists.

Law enforcement officers discovered his plan and served a summons. On April 18, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained a train conductor who was helping men of military age leave for the European Union (EU). It is noted that an employee of the Ukrzaliznytsia company hid men who wanted to leave Ukraine in a ventilation shaft, where they were during passport control. On April 13, the Ukrainian publication Strana.ua reported that the Suvorov military registration and enlistment office in Odessa was forcibly detaining conscripts. It is noted that the wife of one of the detainees, Karina, made the events public.

"27 February 2023","The grain deal cannot be extended in its current status. Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Property, Land and Property Relations Sergei Gavrilov told Izvestia on February 27. A well-worn field: who is behind the illegal export of Russian grain Raw materials from the Russian Federation were supplied to neighboring countries under the guise of Kazakh “Under current conditions, the grain deal cannot be extended in its current status. By mid-March, the issues of using clear mechanisms for insuring our interests, delivering grain to starving countries, and unblocking the accounts of Russian banks with state participation to ensure payments for the export of grain and mineral fertilizers must be resolved,” the deputy said. In his opinion, not only without guarantees , but even without resolving these issues, extending the grain deal is pointless. “The current situation will lead to serious risks - a sharp increase in costs for the Russian side. In order to implement the grain deal for the export, including Ukrainian grain, it would be possible to use the ports of the Azov Sea,” Gavrilov concluded. Earlier that day, a source familiar with the progress of the negotiations told RIA Novosti that Turkey and the UN want firm guarantees for the entry of Russian agricultural products and ammonia into the markets. According to him, this will help the unhindered work of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. On February 22, Deputy Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine Yuriy Vaskov said that Ukraine will ask Turkey and the UN to begin negotiations on extending the grain deal for at least one year. On February 20, RIA Novosti with citing a source, it was reported that in the coming days negotiations on extending the grain deal, which expires on March 18, will resume. There is a high risk that the discussions will be complicated. At the same time, First Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Ivan Abramov noted that the grain deal could be extended, but it is necessary to conduct an analysis and determine where the products actually go. On January 21, the Russian Foreign Ministry indicated, that most of the production under the Black Sea Grain Initiative does not go to poor countries, as expected, but to high-income countries. The food deal was concluded on July 22, 2022 in Istanbul. Then Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres signed a memorandum on facilitating the supply of Russian agricultural products and fertilizers to world markets. At the same time, the Ukrainian delegation signed an agreement with Turkey and the UN on grain exports.

"13 July 2023","Western supplies of cluster munitions to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are doomed to failure. Official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova stated this on July 13 in an interview with the magazine International Affairs. “No matter how the collective West tries to arm the Armed Forces of Ukraine and direct the Ukrainian authorities to continue the confrontation with Russia, these attempts are doomed to failure,” she emphasized. She also noted that the US decision to supply cluster bombs to the Kyiv regime shocked the world. Zakharova emphasized that even the United States did not support this decision of Washington. “Washington’s decision to supply cluster bombs to the Ukrainian Nazis is dictated by its desire to inflict maximum strategic damage on Russia at any cost. The United States admitted that its reserves of conventional shells were depleted, so inhumane types of weapons were used. At the same time, the Americans do not care about the fate of civilians who will die as a result of their criminal deliveries. They are ready in the literal sense of the word “to fight until the last Ukrainian,” notes Zakharova. She stated that the Russian side is aware of the threat the use of cluster bombs poses to the civilian population, so it did not use them during the special operation, but, according to Zakharova, if the Ukrainian Armed Forces will still use such weapons, the Russian Federation will be forced to give a comparable response. Cassette pass: Kyiv is quarreling London and Washington before the NATO summit What was the reason for the split between the allies and why the “special relationship” between the United States and Great Britain is coming to an end Earlier that day, the commander of the Tavria operational-strategic group of troops, General Alexander Tarnavsky, said in an interview with CNN, that the Ukrainian Armed Forces received cluster munitions from the United States. He noted that the decision on the use of cluster bombs in certain territories will be made by senior military leadership. At the same time, Kyiv allegedly guaranteed Washington in writing that it would not use this type of weapon against the civilian population. The day before, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said that the possible use of cluster munitions by Ukraine forces Russia to take certain countermeasures. However, what they will be, according to him, will be decided by the Russian Ministry of Defense. Moreover, on July 11, the city of Tokmak, Zaporozhye region, was already shelled with cluster munitions. The hits were recorded in the area of the poultry farm and at the exit from the city towards Vasilyevka. On the same day, former US President Donald Trump spoke out against the transfer of cluster munitions to Kyiv, saying that such a decision was bringing the world closer to a global war. He noted that if the decision to supply cluster munitions was caused by a shortage of conventional shells in the United States, then this only “confirms the need for immediate de-escalation.” The United States approved the dispatch of cluster munitions as assistance to the Ukrainian Armed Forces on July 7. After this, on July 9, the authorities of several countries allies of the United States in NATO criticized this decision. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and the head of the Spanish Ministry of Defense Margarita Robles opposed. The use of cluster munitions is prohibited by the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which came into force on August 1, 2010, it was signed by 123 countries, but ratified by only 110.

"11 May 2023","European countries are faced with a choice - to accept the fact that their money to help Ukraine ends up in a black hole, or to change their policies. Denis Denisov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, told Izvestia about this on May 11. Thus, he commented on an article by William Nattrass, a columnist for the British magazine The Spectator, which states that the political crisis in Slovakia could deprive Ukraine of its closest ally in Europe. This is due to the possible victory in Slovakia of the SMER party led by Robert Fico, who is “Slovakia’s most controversial politician and a fierce critic of Western policies regarding the conflict in Ukraine.” “Indeed, the threat is that there will be a significant change in Slovakia after the election campaign in the state’s position regarding support for Ukraine. And this, apparently, is only the first sign of changes that are expected in a number of European countries. Here we can focus primarily on sociological research carried out in the European Union, in particular by the Eurobarometer, and based on these data we can say that in a number of European countries the fatigue of the population from the conflict in Ukraine has greatly increased,” said Denisov. According to the political scientist, Slovakia is one of the leaders in the European Union in terms of protest sentiment. Bulgaria, Greece, and Cyprus also express dissatisfaction with assistance to Ukraine. “The situation that is now unfolding in Slovakia is further confirmation that in Europe as a whole, a time of very strong fatigue from the conflict is coming, because the goals and objectives are not clear, pumping Ukraine up with weapons and money does not lead to results. They are faced with a choice - either endlessly finance Ukraine, understand with a clear conscience that money and resources are going into a black hole, or change their policy. Using the example of Slovakia, we will see, I think, an important signal for all European countries,” the expert said. Denisov noted that citizens of a number of European countries demonstrate disagreement with the fact that their governments fully follow the geopolitical choice of the United States. “The populations of various European countries are skeptical to the fact that their states do not pursue national goals, but are integrated into US geopolitical projects, which often only harm these states. The vote in Slovakia should demonstrate how many people do not agree with this,” he concluded. For a handful of zlotys: why Eastern Europe is getting into debt Poland, Hungary and Romania set a record for the amount of borrowing on the world market In April, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, during a trip to Kyiv, said that the alliance member countries had already allocated €150 billion in aid to Ukraine. He noted that the supply of aircraft, tanks and armored vehicles is increasing, and the organization’s fund for Ukraine is providing urgent support, including the delivery of mobile satellite systems. In March, the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, called on the EU countries to allocate €1 billion for the supply of weapons to Ukraine from the European Fund peace. At the same time, he offered a reimbursement rate of up to 90% in exchange for the timely supply of ammunition. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of the worsening situation in the region from -for Ukrainian shelling.

"23 May 2023","The European Union (EU) and the United States need to reach an agreement with Russia on the future security architecture in Europe. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said this on May 23. “We need an agreement with Russia on the future architecture of European security. This must be resolved between Russia and the United States,” he said at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha. Orban noted that negotiations on this issue should take place after the conflict in Ukraine is resolved. He stressed that Hungary stands for an immediate ceasefire to begin peace negotiations. Consult NATO: the Hungarians named a new condition for Kyiv to join the alliance The country's parliament stated that expansion of the bloc at the expense of Ukraine is possible only after an agreement with the Russian Federation. Earlier that day, Orban also said that Kiev would not be able to win the conflict with Moscow, and NATO would not is ready to send its troops to Ukraine. Hungary remains one of the few European countries that regularly opposes the transfer of weapons to Kyiv and calls for a ceasefire and peace negotiations. In particular, on April 24, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó, at a council of foreign ministers of the European Union, said that arms supplies only prolong the conflict. Russia, in turn, has repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Ukraine. In April, the Russian Foreign Ministry sent a note to all NATO countries regarding arms supplies to Kyiv, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in turn, noted that any cargo that contains weapons for the Ukrainian army will become a legal target for Russia. Russian special operation to protect Donbass is held from February 24, 2022. The reason for its holding was the aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

According to some military personnel, they will have no choice but to fight until the end of the military campaign, even despite Kyiv's attempts to mobilize more people to replace those who have been serving for a long time. frontline. “Let's not deceive each other, this won't happen. If we release these people, experienced officers, sergeants, soldiers, <...> if we release them, there will be no one to fight,” Yuriy Fedorenko, commander of the drone division of the 92nd brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, shared with Reuters.

"28 October 2023","Russian President Vladimir Putin knows that the conflict in Ukraine is developing in favor of Russia. This was pointed out by the former director of Russian affairs at the US National Security Council, Fiona Hill, in an interview with Foreign Policy magazine on October 27. According to her, in a situation of escalating conflict in the Middle East, when Washington was faced with the need to provide support not only to Ukraine, but also to Israel , Kyiv is becoming more and more clearly faced with the imminent weakening of Western assistance. Russia benefits from these events, notes Hill. “The confrontation is becoming an internal problem for many countries. In this context, [Russian President] Putin believes that this will be the key to undermining Kyiv’s support for the West, where an increasingly negative perception [of the conflict] could push Ukraine to begin negotiations on Russia’s terms,” the magazine reported her as saying. Hill opined that Western leaders fell victim to inflated expectations about what the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) were actually capable of during the counteroffensive. “We needed a more rational conversation about the capabilities of the Ukrainian military. The Russians have really gained a foothold, building hundreds of kilometers of anti-tank defenses and mines,” she said. Moderate the rear: the Russian army launched 19 strikes on military targets in Ukraine. Accommodation points for militants and mercenaries were destroyed. On the same day, former US military intelligence officer Scott Ritter, in an interview with journalist Garland Nixon, noted that the Russian army is currently conducting operations that will finally eliminate the Ukrainian Armed Forces in in the near future. According to him, against the backdrop of active actions by Russian air defense systems, many pilots of the Ukrainian Armed Forces refused to take off on their fighters. According to him, the anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM) of the Russian Armed Forces instantly destroy them. Earlier, on October 15, the Russian President indicated that Ukraine’s losses during the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian army are estimated at eight to one. He noted that the Russian Armed Forces are improving their position along almost the entire line of contact in the special operation zone. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are preparing new offensive operations in certain areas of hostilities, and the Russian army knows about this and reacts accordingly, the head of state added. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues.

"18 September 2023","Germany, which needs an influx of labor, takes away a valuable resource from Poland - Ukrainian refugees. This statement was made by observers of the Croatian publication Advance. According to journalists, last time during the panic that gripped Germany due to a shortage of labor, the German leadership led by Angela Merkel “came up with” bringing migrants, primarily from poor countries in Africa and the Middle East and Asia. It is noted that the Berlin authorities presented this decision to the world as “highly moral concern” on the part of economically developed Germany. But “the reality was shining through” in labor market data, which showed that “traditional” German sources of labor, such as the Balkans or Eastern Europe, had dried up. “However, another, new source of labor has recently emerged - Ukraine,” they note. authors of the article. According to the observer, at the very beginning of the Ukrainian conflict, millions of refugees from this country settled in Poland, which took on the role of “one of the main Ukrainian allies,” however, changes in this situation are now being observed, since at the moment there is an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians in Europe are in Germany. “And what’s happening? Now there is a real exodus of Ukrainian refugees from Poland. They leave for Germany, where they are attracted by higher salaries and other government benefits,” the material says. In this situation, the Warsaw authorities do not show much joy, the author notes, since the Poles hoped to acquire labor in the form of Ukrainian refugees. “But Germany Poland has been outdone. Figures show that more than 350 thousand Ukrainian refugees have left Poland over the past year, that is, since August 2022, and most of them have moved to Germany,” Advance points out. At the same time, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has increased assistance to the Kyiv authorities in recent months, supplying more and more weapons, and this undoubtedly contributes to the prolongation of the armed conflict, the journalist writes. “We can say that Olaf Scholz has found a new source of labor, thus solving his main problem, as did his predecessor Angela Merkel. The German “economic locomotive” will rush further and even faster, and Berlin is interested in this. The main thing here, as you know, is to set a goal, and the means will be found,” the author sums up. “The egregious situation with refugees is being retouched in Ukraine and the EU” Dozens of Ukrainians turned to Russia because of the abduction of their children in Europe On September 16, Germany called for a refusal to extradite Ukrainian refugees for service in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). This opinion was expressed by Burkhart Evert, editor-in-chief of the political section of the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung newspaper. He also pointed out that now the Ukrainian authorities should ensure the freedom of citizens, and not restrict them. Prior to this, on September 5, it was reported that due to significant losses at the front, Ukraine would turn to Europe with a request to return male refugees of military age. It was noted that conflicts had already arisen in Poland and Moldova due to attempts by the Ukrainian side to do this. The day before, the newspaper Rzeczpospolita wrote that Poland began to extradite men of military age who illegally left Ukraine after the start of the special operation. The publication noted that the Polish authorities have already extradited Ukrainians who were involved in transporting illegal migrants to the European Union (EU). Earlier, on August 25, Ukraine reported the number of men who left the country during the special operation. According to the Institute of Demography of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, about 5 million people left the country, excluding those who went to Russia.

Reuters reported this on August 17, citing a US official. “Washington has given official assurances to Denmark and the Netherlands that the United States will expedite approval of all necessary third-party requests for the transfer of F-16 fighters to Ukraine so that it receives the aircraft when pilots will be trained,” the report said. Denmark and the Netherlands, which are responsible for training Ukrainian pilots, recently requested these guarantees. According to the official, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent letters to his Danish and Dutch counterparts, assuring them that the requests would be approved. “I am writing to express the full support of the United States in both the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine and the training of Ukrainian pilots with qualified instructors,” Blinken said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by the agency.

He also noted that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are not yet ready to host such “rather capricious aircraft”, since there is no road structure and other support. On August 13, the Ukrainian publication UNIAN reported that the United States is not transferring F-16 fighters to Ukraine, since the Russian Armed Forces will be able to shoot down them with ease, which in turn will demonstrate the ineffectiveness of NATO doctrines and the futility of gigantic financial investments in military affairs. The authors of the publication note that the Ukrainian air force is not as strong as the Russian army aviation. Prior to this, on August 4, the Politico newspaper reported that the insufficient level of English language skills among Ukrainian pilots was a problem for their training on F-16 fighters. In this regard, 20 military personnel will begin language courses in the UK. At the end of July, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Ukraine would receive F-16 fighters, but their transfer would take several months. He noted that it is important to prepare the Ukrainian military to operate fighter jets. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022.

Thus, he commented on the visit of American Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Kyiv on September 6: “We have repeatedly heard statements that they intend to continue to help Kyiv as long as necessary. In other words, they are going to continue to support Ukraine in a virtual state of war and continue to wage this war until the last Ukrainian, not sparing any money for it. We perceive it this way, we know it,” Peskov said at a briefing. He noted that support from Washington is not capable of influencing the special operation. As media reported, Blinken arrived on an official visit to Ukraine earlier that day. It was noted that during the visit, the Secretary of State may announce a new package of military assistance to the country worth more than $1 billion. “The West will move to a strategy of long-term conflict” Experts assessed the results of the meeting on Ukraine in Saudi Arabia Commenting on his arrival, a political scientist, chairman of the Crimean regional public organization “Center for Political Education” Ivan Mezyukho, in a conversation with Izvestia, suggested that Blinken might try to persuade Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to negotiate with Russia.

The TSN television channel reported this on February 26. “In Transcarpathia, Ukrainians of Hungarian origin were sent messages calling for them to get out of Ukraine,” says a message published on the TSN Telegram channel. It is assumed that the messages are being sent by Ukrainian nationalists with the aim of provoking interethnic strife. The messages, as the TV channel notes, come from numbers from mobile operators in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Bosnia and Herzegovina. You Magyars don’t know well: Hungary does not want to allocate money to Ukraine and accept it into the EU The SBU suspected Orban of collaborating with Russian intelligence services Earlier, on January 28, the Hungarian politician, head of the Our Motherland party Laszlo Torockai said that if Ukraine loses statehood, then Transcarpathia how autonomy could reunite with Hungary peacefully. At the same time, Torotskai noted that at that time only the Our Motherland party had expressed claims to Transcarpathia; the other parliamentary parties did not make such claims. In November 2023, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that the situation with the Hungarian language in Transcarpathia under the USSR was better than under Ukraine. According to Orban, Ukraine “continues to punish Transcarpathians,” so Hungary will provide them with the necessary assistance. Transcarpathia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the First World War and the collapse of the Habsburg Empire, the region became part of Czechoslovakia, within which it existed until 1939, when it was annexed by Hungary.

"21 July 2023","The lands that Poland received after the end of World War II laid the foundations for Soviet-Polish friendship in the post-war period, but now the country is interested in territorial expansion in order to “throw back Russia.” This opinion was expressed on July 21 by historian Dmitry Surzhik, commenting on the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin that the western territories of modern Poland were a gift from Joseph Stalin to Warsaw. The historian explained that after the end of World War II, Poland received a number of territories, including parts of Eastern and Western Prussia. These lands, as Surzhik noted, were transferred mainly at the insistence of the Soviet leadership in the interests of Poland, the future Polish People's Republic. He believes that in this way the leadership of the USSR tried to lay the foundations of friendship between Moscow and Warsaw. “As we remember, in interwar Poland the doctrine of Prometheism, which was clearly directed against the USSR, prevailed, and the Polish People's Republic, whether due to these territorial changes or for other reasons, was quite loyal to the Soviet Union,” the historian explained. As Surzhik added, revanchist sentiments are strongly manifested in modern Poland. This also applies to the ruling Law and Justice party, which for decades has been preoccupied with the “intermarium concept.” “This concept is that Poland should subordinate to its influence, or better yet, expand territorially and occupy lands from the Baltic to the Black Sea. sea in order to push Russia away from these territories,” the historian noted.

The head of state said this against the backdrop of a statement by Polish President Andrzej Duda that he would allow the military to be sent to Ukraine after the conflict. According to Duda, NATO could send a peacekeeping mission there, in which Polish soldiers would participate and monitor compliance with the ceasefire. Putin explained this with the purpose of occupying the territory of Ukraine. On that day, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, emphasized that Poland was not interested in Ukraine joining NATO, because Warsaw could lay claim to the appropriation of Ukrainian territories.

De Croo noted that Belgium already sees the parameters of a future agreement between the EU countries, but the day before it was not possible to agree on the allocation of funds. “When Ukraine joined, we said very clearly: you will be members of the European Union at some point in time if all the reforms are carried out.

In an interview with the radio station, he also commented on the suspension of Russia’s participation in the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New START, START-3).

A day earlier, Borrell spoke about a dialogue with the head of the office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China, Wang Yi, during which the Chinese representative asked why his country should not supply weapons to Russia if the European Union supplies them to Ukraine.

"June 2023","An air raid alert was announced on the morning of Friday, June 2, in three regions of Ukraine. This follows from the data of the official resource for alerting citizens. The Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk and Poltava regions are currently in the “red” zone. An air raid alert has also been declared in Kyiv-controlled areas of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). Something went wrong with the tank: why the Ukrainian Armed Forces are not launching a counter-offensive Experts explained what to expect from the Ukrainian army Earlier that day, Ukrainian media reported that explosions were heard in Kyiv and in the Cherkassy region. Explosions also occurred in the Kharkov region. An air raid alert was announced throughout Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defense has not yet commented on the information about the explosions. At night and in the morning of June 1, an air alert sounded in the Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov regions and the Kyiv-controlled part of the Zaporozhye region. The Russian military began to strike critical objects of Ukrainian infrastructure from October 10, 2022. As Russian President Vladimir Putin noted then, this was a response to the terrorist actions of the Kyiv regime, in particular, on the Crimean Bridge. Since February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation has been conducting a special operation to protect Donbass, whose residents refused to recognize the results of the 2014 coup in Ukraine. The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by Ukrainian troops.

"28 February 2023","The threat of a possible provocation of the United States in Ukraine using toxic substances in a special military operation (SVO) zone indicates an attempt by the West to set in motion the “Syrian scenario.” This opinion was expressed by Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Defense Yuri Shvytkin on Tuesday, February 28. They followed: the commission on biological laboratories in Ukraine will meet on January 23. What will be the main topic of the meeting of deputies and senators Shvytkin noted that Russia is taking all possible actions to prevent such events. The deputy emphasized that representatives of both diplomatic and defense departments are involved in this work. “Russia is working to forestall these events, we will make public the intelligence that we have about attempts to create provocations against our country from Ukraine and a number of Western countries on Russia's use of relevant types of weapons. We are working through political and diplomatic channels to prevent this,” the deputy said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. He added that the United States is trying to set in motion the Syrian scenario, when there were also various chemical attacks and they tried to blame all responsibility for this on Russia. Shvytkin also admitted the possibility of introducing new sanctions against Russia in connection with possible provocations. “More sanctions - I do not exclude this, because many countries today are doing everything at the behest of the United States, and it is quite likely that this could happen. This definitely cannot be ruled out,” he concluded. Earlier that day, the head of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Troops (RCBZ) of the Russian Armed Forces, Igor Kirillov, said that the United States and its accomplices intend to organize a provocation in Ukraine using toxic chemicals, accusing Russia of this , reports the Federal News Agency. According to him, on February 22, an influential American non-governmental organization held a conference dedicated to the events in Ukraine, according to the website aif.ru. During the event, former US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan made a statement saying that “Russian troops plan to use chemical weapons in the zone of a special military operation.” The Russian defense department regarded this information as the intention of the United States itself and its accomplices to carry out in Ukraine, a provocation using toxic chemicals. In addition, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, on February 10, 2023, 11 wagons of irritant ammunition were unloaded in Kramatorsk, writes Life.Ru. The head of the RCBZ also added that in the same month, the Euro-Atlantic Coordination Center for Disaster Response planned the delivery of a large batch of personal protective equipment to Ukraine, as well as 600 thousand doses of antidotes against toxic substances. The Ministry of Defense believes that the United States is counting on that the blame for the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine will be placed on Russia. In April last year, the Russian Foreign Ministry reported a very real threat of chemical terrorism from Ukrainian nationalists. As Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Oleg Syromolotov stated then, Kyiv is hatching plans for chemical provocations in the Donbass. The Russian Foreign Ministry also did not rule out a repetition of “terrorist attacks against enterprises with toxic substances.” The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"28 September 2023","The US State Department is preparing for a possible shutdown in the event that Congress does not decide on the budget for the new fiscal year. Department official Matthew Miller announced this on September 28. “We are developing a contingency plan if a shutdown occurs,” he said at a briefing. According to him, it will be decided in the near future which functions will be considered vital for national security and preserved, and which will be temporarily suspended from October 1. Complete shutdown: in the United States there is a threat of a government shutdown By the end of the month, Congress must formulate a budget for the next fiscal year. On September 23, it was reported that the US government has begun preparations for a possible shutdown that could happen if legislators cannot agree on an extension of funding. If no resolution is reached, millions of government and military workers will not be paid, and federal programs - from some food safety inspections to child care funds - will come to an abrupt halt. In addition, some national parks and museums may close, and there will be disruptions and delays at airports across the country. On the same day, US President Joe Biden called on members of the Republican Party to prevent a US government shutdown. He stressed that the government shutdown will affect everything from food security to children's education programs. The American leader called on the Republicans to return to the budget issue. Commenting on these events, American political scientist Malek Dudakov told Izvestia that the suspension of the US government will lead to a reduction in aid to Ukraine. In his opinion, Biden has no way to avoid a shutdown - this process will happen automatically on October 1. However, as the Americanist noted, this will not lead to any immediate disaster for the American government. On September 26, US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy called on the American president to personally intervene in the situation with the impending shutdown due to the lack of general agreement on the adoption of the country’s interim budget. He also noted that it would be very important to hold a meeting with Biden to prevent a government shutdown.

"27 April 2023","White House President Joe Biden's policy in Ukraine is reminiscent of what former American President George W. Bush did in Afghanistan. Analyst Andrew Napolitano on April 26, in a column for The Washington Times, called this a “moral depravity.” It is clarified that Bush at one time convinced Congress of the need to teach the people of Afghanistan a lesson, regardless of the degree of their guilt in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As a result, much of it was destroyed and hundreds of thousands of innocent people died. “This moral depravity was committed in the name of retribution, deterrence and liberation, but in reality the cause was American arrogance. And now this is being repeated in Ukraine,” the material says. Bush’s reputation has suffered, and now the current US president has every chance of sharing his fate, the analyst added. Increase supplies: will Kyiv receive weapons for a counter-offensive? The 11th meeting of the contact group on Ukraine was held in Germany at the American Ramstein base. The day before, American human rights activist Ajamu Baraka announced the US preparation for an Afghan scenario in Ukraine. Thus, he commented on information in the media that Washington warned Kyiv against excessive military ambition. According to the publication, former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani received a similar message in 2021 shortly before the fall of Kabul. On March 27, columnist Thomas Lifeson spoke about the serious mistakes that the US President made during the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. In his opinion, the decision to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan was the collapse of foreign policy for Biden. As a result, Washington lost expensive weapons, which ended up in the hands of the Taliban (the Taliban movement, the organization is under UN sanctions for terrorist activities). In addition, on March 12, Donald Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton said that the miscalculations of US President Joe Biden's defense policy could have serious consequences. If the US authorities do not take national security policy more seriously, then “it will come back to haunt the Americans,” he said.

"March 2024","The conflict between Ukraine and Poland in the trade sphere has brought benefits to Russia, and it did not provoke this crisis. The Politico newspaper reported this on March 6. The publication noted that problems with blocking the passage of Ukrainian transport with grain on the Polish-Ukrainian border emphasized Russia’s position as the world’s leading exporter of cereal crops. Russian agricultural products, according to Politico, move freely throughout Europe: for example, they are imported into Poland across the border with Belarus, and no obstacles are created for carriers there. As Gazeta.Ru adds, Poland itself is among the buyers of products from the Russian agricultural sector, and by this, in fact, blocks and isolates Ukraine, which he calls his ally. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk blamed Russian imports for the losses of Polish farmers and the crisis at the border, but Politico noted that there is nothing to prove his words. The publication recalled that in January Latvia tried to achieve a ban on the import of agricultural products from the Russian Federation throughout the European Union (EU), but failed because other states, such as Spain and Italy, were not ready to impose such an embargo because they are large buyers of Russian grain and cannot refuse it. Politico also emphasizes that Russian food is not subject to Western sanctions that prohibit the purchase and import of energy resources and some other goods from the Russian Federation. The border is locked: Poland has threatened to stop the transit of goods from Ukraine According to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, such a measure will be painful for both countries. Earlier, on March 6, Polish Minister of Agriculture Czeslaw Sekierski said that Warsaw and Kyiv are trying to avoid a complete closure of the common border for cargo transportation. There is currently an embargo on wheat, sunflower, corn and rapeseed, but further bans, he said, will harm the Polish economy. Polish farmers regularly block roads in the republic. On March 1, they blocked local highway No. 15 and demanded a meeting with the Prime Minister of their country, Donald Tusk. They added that they are not afraid of the police and do not want to see Deputy Minister of Agriculture Michal Kolodziejczak. Farmers are demanding the introduction of an embargo on the supply of agricultural products from Ukraine and the state’s withdrawal from the EU Green Deal program, which concerns the achievement of carbon neutrality in the alliance countries by 2050. At six checkpoints on the Polish-Ukrainian border on February 27, there were a total of 2, 1 thousand trucks that were stuck due to blocked checkpoints. Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine Alexander Kubrakov said that on February 25, unknown persons poured approximately 160 tons of Ukrainian grain from sealed wagons, which were being transported to the port of Gdansk. He called the incident “impunity and irresponsibility,” recalling that this is the fourth such case. Polish carriers and farmers began blocking automobile checkpoints on the border with Ukraine in early November last year. Among their demands was the introduction of commercial permits for Ukrainian carriers and a limit on the number of Ukrainian heavy trucks entering Poland.

"September 2023","Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba assured that Kyiv does not plan to use long-range Taurus missiles outside the “internationally recognized borders” of the republic in the event of their transfer from Germany. He announced this on September 5 in an interview with the German television channel Welt. “Ukraine will not use Taurus cruise missiles outside the internationally recognized borders of our country,” the minister said. Kuleba expressed hope that the delivery of missiles will take place in the near future, noting that the transfer of weapons depends only on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. “I would not like to put pressure on him, but I hope that the decision will be made quickly, and not just in a few months. We have constantly encountered this topic since last year,” the minister added. Having touched on the topic of possible negotiations with Russia, Kuleba took an extremely tough position. The head of Ukrainian diplomacy also noted that he has a negative attitude towards the creation of a demarcation line. In his opinion, such a decision will not contribute to ending the conflict. Not out of fear, but like this: the Russian Armed Forces are holding lines in the Rabotino area. Ukrainian militants are trying to advance in the Zaporozhye direction, but to no avail. Despite Kuleba’s repeated statements that weapons supplied from the West will not be used on Russian territory, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense Ukraine Kirill Budanov said on September 1 that the conflict should be transferred to the Russian Federation. In addition, Kyiv regularly carries out terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation, including using drones. Deliveries of Taurus missiles were planned by the German government in early August. Discussion of this issue began after French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his readiness to transfer long-range missiles to Kyiv on July 11. On August 21, German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said that Germany had not yet made a decision on the transfer of long-range Taurus missiles to Kiev. On August 26, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stressed that all German actions related to future arms supplies to Ukraine will be carefully weighed, and there will be no rash steps in this matter. The special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

"13 September 2023","Ukraine’s refusal to engage in a constructive diplomatic dialogue that could resolve the armed conflict with Russia threatens the republic with its complete destruction. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy reported this on September 13 in an interview for the BFMTV channel. “There are two ways to resolve the conflict: either the destruction of one of the conflicting parties, and I warn here that we are not talking about the second nuclear power in the world. Then the planet could slide into all-out war. Or a diplomatic dialogue,” said the former French president. Sarkozy, looking back on his experience in the presidency, expressed confidence that it is possible to build a constructive dialogue with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. “I may have had more than 80 conversations with him [Putin].” , said Nicolas Sarkozy. Counter-offensive on Ukraine: why the West is talking about a truce with Russia Kyiv is preparing for a “difficult political season” Earlier, on August 16, Sarkozy in an interview with Figaro said that talk about the return of Crimea to Ukraine is an illusion.

"April 2023","The Kyiv authorities will not agree to the truce proposed by Pope Francis during the Easter celebration because of the planned counter-offensive, Vladimir Rogov, chairman of the “We are together with Russia” movement in the Zaporozhye region, told TASS on Friday, April 7. According to him, the United States insists on the operation of the offensive of the Ukrainian army in the south of the country, so this proposal cannot be considered. He also recalled Russia’s past attempts, both during the special operation (SVO) and before it, to establish a truce. “Each of them (truces. - Ed.) was violated by the Kiev side. It doesn’t matter whether it was the regime of Poroshenko (former head of Ukraine) or Zelensky (current president of Ukraine). All this was hypocrisy, [the truce] was used for regrouping, pulling up troops, equipment and ammunition,” Rogov noted. Recalling the proposal of Patriarch Kirill and the Russian Orthodox Church to introduce a Christmas truce at the beginning of the year, Rogov emphasized that even then the Ukrainian side was once again the first started shelling. Western course: the Russian army continues its offensive in the Donbass Izvestia correspondents visited the positions of Kostroma paratroopers near Kremennaya The date of Orthodox Easter this year is April 16, Catholics celebrate it a week earlier - April 9. Earlier on this day, the head of the Union of Old Believers Leonid Sevastyanov after In a personal conversation with Pope Francis, he said that he made a proposal to establish a two-week truce in Ukraine in connection with the Easter holidays. A truce is proposed to be established from April 9 for the duration of Easter for Catholics and Orthodox Christians. Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov, in turn, said that the Vatican did not officially propose to establish an Easter truce. Prior to this, on February 6, the adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, Mikhail Podolyak opposed the temporary truce in Ukraine. In his opinion, a temporary truce in the conflict will only lead to aggravation of the situation. In early January, Patriarch Kirill called for the establishment of a Christmas truce in the zone of a special military operation in Ukraine and Donbass. He called on the parties to the conflict to “cease fire” on January 7 so that people could attend services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

"14 April 2023","Some of Ukraine’s allies in Europe are skeptical about the prospects for a counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops and do not believe in the possibility of a significant breakthrough. This was reported on Friday, April 14, by Bloomberg, citing sources in European political circles. “The mood among Western officials is sharply different from what it was late last year, when Kyiv surprised its allies, as well as Russia, with a pair of successful counter-offensives . <...> This fueled hopes that he could make further breakthroughs this year. Now Kyiv’s allies are reining in their expectations,” the publication says. European officials believe that the conflict will continue into 2024, and a breakthrough may not occur until next year. The counteroffensive should supposedly be aimed at Melitopol in the Zaporozhye region. At the same time, according to the agency’s interlocutors, even an advance of 30 km in the direction of Melitopol will cost Ukraine thousands of soldiers’ lives and a large amount of Western equipment.

"26 July 2023","Washington’s “pumping up” of weapons on its Ukrainian puppets is beyond morality and common sense, since it essentially sponsors the terrorist Kiev regime, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said on July 25. “Having set foot on the path of war, Washington is unable to stop. Instead of soberly assessing what is happening, local strategists are sponsoring the terrorist plans of Kyiv criminals. For example, continue attacks on the Crimean Bridge, which is not a military facility, since it has not been used for transporting goods for the Russian Armed Forces for a long time,” the Telegram channel of the Russian diplomatic mission quotes the diplomat as saying. In his commentary, Antonov emphasizes that the US achievements on the chosen path will be even more human suffering and death. “You can be sure: shells and missiles, paid for with billions of dollars from the pockets of American taxpayers, will result in ruined cities and fields strewn with unexploded ordnance, crippled lives,” he notes. Ambassador Antonov wonders how many more American The Bradley infantry fighting vehicle must burn out so that the US leadership realizes the futility of trying to defeat our country “on the battlefield,” which will only lead “to the inglorious defeat of the Russophobes.” Jet assistance: what threat does Ukraine's missile arsenal pose Kyiv has Soviet and Western-made ammunition at its disposal On July 25, the Pentagon announced the allocation of a new package of military assistance to Ukraine worth $400 million. The list of transferred weapons will include shells for Patriot and NASAMS anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM), HIMARS multiple launch rocket system and more. On July 14, the US House of Representatives approved the country's draft defense budget for the 2024 fiscal year, the cost of which will be about $886 billion. The document provides for the allocation of $80 million, which will be spent on ATACMS missiles for Kiev. Western countries have strengthened their military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which has been ongoing since February 24, 2022. The corresponding decision was made in connection with the aggravation of the situation in the region due to attacks by Ukrainian militants.

"December 2 2023","Pessimistic sentiments among military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are intensifying, as they understand that they do not have enough resources to confront the Russian Armed Forces. This was stated by the journalist of the Danish radio DR Mathilde Kimer. “A big disappointment for the Ukrainians was that, as it seems to them, the Russians have inexhaustible resources. Ukrainians literally stand and look into a half-empty garage, where there is nothing to shoot from,” she writes in the article dated November 30. The journalist also noted that Ukrainians see that the conflict has reached a dead end, and “the prospects for progress are small.” And the main rhetoric among the military and civilian population is about how one can talk about military operations if there is nothing to fight with. A group of strange ones: at what point will the EU start saving in Ukraine? And at whose expense is the association trying to increase military assistance to Kyiv? On November 24, military expert Anatoly Matviychuk said that the main problem of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front is currently related to the lack of weapons, ammunition and people. The same idea was expressed on November 14 by military expert, director of the Museum of Air Defense Forces Yuri Knutov. He noted that it is the lack of ammunition that is forcing Kyiv to redistribute forces. Earlier, on November 12, The Wall Street Journal wrote that Ukrainian Armed Forces military personnel are complaining that there is a significant shortage of ammunition and manpower. In connection with Russia’s buildup of combat power and the transfer of the country’s economy “to a war footing,” the new phase of the conflict looks unfavorable for Ukraine, the newspaper also points out. At the same time, military expert Andrei Koshkin, in a conversation with Izvestia, expressed the opinion that statements about a shortage of ammunition Kyiv is trying to return the attention of the collective West to the country after the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"12 August 2023","Artillerymen of the Southern Group of Forces, using propaganda shells, are distributing leaflets in the northern direction calling on the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) to lay down their arms and go home. The work of the artillerymen on Saturday, August 12, was shown by Izvestia. The footage shows how leaflets are first folded in a certain way and then loaded into special shells. When such ammunition explodes, the materials spread over a large area. With their help, mobilized Ukrainians are warned against death and called upon to lay down their arms. “The Kiev regime does not represent Ukraine” Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov talks about the future of the western regions of his country and the authors of the “Zelensky plan” On August 11, Ukrainian Armed Forces prisoner of war Ivan told Izvestia about forced mobilization in the country and the lack of proper preparation for military operations. According to him, he was handed a summons after stopping the car at a traffic police checkpoint. Prior to this, on August 10, ex-officer of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Taras Chmut said that mobilization in Ukraine would affect hundreds of thousands of men due to the need to make up for losses in the ranks of the Ukrainian military. Over the course of a year and a half, Kyiv has lost, irrevocably or due to injuries, a “huge number” of motivated, experienced soldiers, he specified. The special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

"30 August 2023","The Russian military has changed its strategy for conducting combat operations in the special military operation zone, which has reduced the effectiveness of the American HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems, which Ukraine received from Western partners. This was stated on August 30 in a publication on the website of Newsweek. According to the British mercenary Aidan Aslin, Russia has adapted to the strategy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) to use missiles to attack key positions. Important Russian army installations are now located outside the HIMARS coverage area, due to why the complex lost its relevance on the battlefield, he clarified. To date, Washington has sent 38 HIMARS systems to Ukraine, adds Gazeta.Ru. A day earlier, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced the US allocation of a new package of military assistance to Ukraine . It will include additional mine clearance equipment, missiles for air defense systems, ammunition for artillery and HIMARS systems, as well as more than 3 million rounds of ammunition. Reserve for battle: what long-range missiles can Kyiv receive and how can they affect the course of a special military operation? The cost of weapons transferred as part of this package will be $250 million. Earlier, in the second half of July, the Pentagon announced the allocation of two packages of military assistance to Kyiv with a total cost of more than $1.7 billion: thus, the first package included, among other things, four improved NASAMS air defense systems and ammunition for them, and the second package included shells for the NASAMS, Patriot and HIMARS systems. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect the Donbass , which runs from February 24, 2022.

"27 May 2023","Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Galuzin said on May 27 that the United States wants to prolong the conflict in Ukraine as much as possible and make it even more bloody. He drew attention to the fact that the United States and its NATO allies in recent months have expanded the range of arms supplies to Ukraine, including heavy tanks , strike artillery, long-range cruise missiles. “There is now talk about providing F-16 aircraft to Kyiv. There is a clear desire of Washington and London to raise the stakes in the conflict, to prolong it as much as possible, to make it even more bloody,” the deputy head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said in an interview with TASS. Galuzin believes that statements by the Ukrainian leadership and regular comments by Western politicians about the upcoming counter-offensive are a reflection of the line of the “Anglo-Saxons ""to inflict strategic defeat on Russia. “Neither the West nor the Kyiv regime needs peace in Ukraine” Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Galuzin - about the risks of further NATO expansion to the east and negotiations with Ukraine The day before, First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs Alexei Chepa said that the United States supports Ukraine in the conflict with Russia, because they want to continue hostilities between the countries. On the same day, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council (SC) of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev expressed the opinion that the Ukrainian conflict could drag on for decades. In addition, as long as such power remains in Ukraine as it is now, conflicts, even taking into account hypothetical two-three-year truces, will be repeated. On May 9, US Army Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis said that the main goal of the United States in the Ukrainian conflict is to inflict as much damage as possible more harm to Russia. In this regard, Washington will try to delay it for as long as possible. Meanwhile, on May 2, former adviser to ex-President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin said that in the coming months Kyiv will completely lose military and financial support from the United States. The expert cited two factors as arguments: problems in the economy of the United States of America and the loss of American interest in providing assistance to Kiev. At the same time, the head of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces (AF) General Mark Milley said that the conflict in Ukraine is unlikely to end in 2023. How former US Marine Corps (MCC) intelligence officer Scott Ritter said on April 13, if the US authorities officially decide to intervene in the conflict on the territory of Ukraine, this will lead to a dangerous escalation of the conflict. According to Ritter, Zelensky is deliberately prolonging the crisis in Europe in the hope that NATO member countries will become involved in the conflict against Moscow. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which the Russian authorities announced on 24 February 2022 as a result of the aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"28 June 2023","China at a certain stage may play a role in resolving the conflict in Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this on June 28. “We agreed that these conversations must be continued. There may come a time, if a window opens for real diplomacy and negotiations, where China can play a positive and productive role. But this, it seems to me, alas, is in the distant future,” he told MSNBC. Blinken said that he discussed resolving the conflict during a visit to China. According to him, the PRC is now looking for ways to provide support to Russia, while maintaining “the appearance of neutrality and trying to present itself as a peacemaker.” Braking distance: why Anthony Blinken is flying to Beijing The US Secretary of State will only be able to stop the escalation of relations with China, experts say. Earlier, on June 20, it became known from a Reuters article that the leaders of the European Union (EU) intend to turn to China with a request to help end the conflict in Ukraine. Europe also calls on the PRC to get involved in solving global problems such as climate change. Prior to this, on May 26, German Foreign Ministry spokesman Christian Wagner admitted that German representatives at a meeting with the PRC Special Representative for Eurasian Affairs Li Hui in Berlin called on China to influence Russia in context of the Ukrainian crisis. According to the diplomat, Michaelis asked the PRC to condemn Moscow’s actions and refuse to supply weapons to Russia. At the same time, the Chinese side has repeatedly stated that it does not supply weapons to Russia. In mid-May, China's special representative for Eurasian affairs Li Hui, during negotiations with the Ukrainian authorities, said that Beijing is ready to assist the international community in forming a common position on resolving the Ukrainian crisis, as well as to make own efforts to quickly restore peace. China at the end of February presented its plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. In it, Beijing called on all parties to stop hostilities, abandon the Cold War mentality and begin peace negotiations, declaring its readiness to provide a platform for the meeting. At the same time, the PRC opposed attacks on nuclear power plants and nuclear facilities, and also repeated the thesis that nuclear wars should not be waged.

"11 March 2023","few days before the sabotage on the Nord Stream, a 182-meter tanker flying a Greek flag was parked near the site of the explosions, Business Insider reported on Friday, March 10, citing analyst Oliver Alexander. According to him, the tanker was heading east from Rotterdam, however, on September 6 it stopped in the Baltic Sea and remained until the 12th, alternately standing idle and circling over two gas pipelines. The tanker then headed to Tallinn before anchoring on September 18 in St. Petersburg, the newspaper writes. A representative for Minerva Julie confirmed its location during the specified period. He said the ship had been there for seven days awaiting further voyage instructions, which was ""standard shipping practice"". The representative did not provide information about whether investigators contacted him. Oliver Alexander does not undertake to claim that the Greek tanker became a participant in a geopolitical crime. However, the crew of the ship may, one way or another, give evidence that will help in the investigation of sabotage on Russian gas pipelines. Head to head: is there a chance for an international investigation into the explosions? Joint venture Russia calls for a collective search for answers, the opposition in Germany proposes to create a special commission Earlier this day, details appeared about a ship that could be involved in the Nord Stream explosion. The organizers of the sabotage rented a 15-meter sailing yacht called “Andromeda” and allegedly used it to transport explosive devices. On March 8, German authorities initiated a search of a ship allegedly related to sabotage on the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines. . In January, federal prosecutors searched the ship in connection with its suspicious lease; a number of material evidence was seized and is being examined. Earlier, on March 7, the American edition of The New York Times published an article indicating the possible involvement of a pro-Ukrainian group in the attack on Nord Streams. . From the material it follows: some US officials believe that Ukraine and its allies had the most logical potential motive for attacking the pipelines. Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov said that publications about explosions at Nord Stream are a coordinated hoax. He also expressed bewilderment at how American officials cited by the media can assume something about the terrorist attacks on Nord Stream without investigation. US journalist Seymour Hersh called The New York Times article about the involvement of Ukrainians in the attack on the joint venture stupid. The journalist learned about the article during a conversation with Izvestia. He also told Izvestia that he would publish a new investigation into Nord Stream next week. Leaks at Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 were discovered in September 2022. A representative of the Swedish seismic center, Björn Lund, said that two powerful underwater explosions were recorded in the area of pipeline leaks at the time of the emergency. Traces of explosives were found at the scene of the accident. The Russian Federation called the incident an act of state terrorism.

Polish Minister of National Defense Mariusz Blaszczak announced this on May 8. “We have delivered ten MiG-29s to Ukraine,” the head of the military department said in a speech on the Canadian television channel CPAC. The statement by the head of the Polish Ministry of Defense was made in Ottawa after a meeting with his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand . Guarantee of irresponsibility: Warsaw promised Kyiv new fighters How the next arms deliveries will affect the course of the North Military District and what else Zelensky agreed on during his visit to Poland Before this, on April 3, the Polish authorities announced that they had transferred several MiG-29 fighters to Kyiv. At the same time, Polish President Andrzej Duda, on April 5, after a meeting with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in Warsaw, announced that the republic would transfer only 14 MiG-29 fighters to Ukraine, leaving copies upgraded to NATO standards. Later, on April 17, Slovakia announced the transfer of 13 fighters MiG-29 to Kyiv. As the country's Defense Minister Jaroslav Nagy noted, these aircraft are of no practical use to Slovakia itself, while Ukraine may need them. The first four aircraft were sent on March 23. Commenting on this news, Deputy Head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Alexander Grushko noted that the MiG-29s transferred to Kyiv will supplement the Russian statistics of downed aircraft in Ukraine. In particular, several such aircraft were shot down in early April in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), he pointed out. On April 23, The Economist magazine indicated that many of the MiG-29 fighters that Poland and Slovakia recently sent to Ukraine were dismantled for parts . The article indicates that many aircraft are in non-flyable condition.

"23 February 2024","The front line is crumbling under the pressure of the Russian army, while the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are critically short of shells due to delays in supplies from the West. The Ukrainian publication “Zerkalo Nedeli” reported this on February 23, publishing a video message from a Western military medic of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Telegram. “The damn front line is crumbling from all sides. How do you justify such inaction?” - the mercenary says about the delays in aid deliveries to Ukraine's allies. The mercenary also said that he is ashamed to be a Westerner, since Western countries do not provide Kyiv with the necessary support. Earlier that day, the Financial Times newspaper, citing officials familiar with the situation, wrote that in the European Union intend to raise an additional $1.5 billion to transfer artillery shells from other countries to Ukraine. Journalists also reported that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are forced to limit the use of artillery, which has a negative impact on repelling attacks by the Russian army. The cherished dose: the United States decided not to rush to help Ukraine Zelensky personally flew to Washington for weapons and money, but there is almost no chance of getting them. Also on Friday, February 23, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said that US allies may be disappointed in Washington if Congress will not approve assistance to Ukraine in the amount of about $60 billion. According to him, the United States cannot always help, even the country’s commander-in-chief wants this. On February 9, US President Joe Biden, during a meeting at the White House with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, called the Republican Party’s delay in providing assistance the Ukrainian side is akin to criminal negligence. A bill implying $60 billion in aid to Ukraine was presented to the upper house of the American parliament on February 4. The initiative also implies the allocation of $14.1 billion to Israel and $20.2 billion to strengthen the border with Mexico due to the serious problem with the high number of illegal migrants. At the same time, The Guardian noted that the document is more likely not to pass approval by the House of Representatives, since Speaker Mike Johnson criticized the bill for lacking provisions to address problems at the Mexican border.

"January 2 2024","Residents of Ukraine will have to decide whether to advocate for holding presidential elections in the country or again conduct a counter-offensive on the battlefield. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said this on January 1 in an interview with The Economist magazine. “Let's be honest, we have switched to domestic politics. If we continue to focus on domestic politics, we will need to call elections. Change laws, constitution. But forget about counter-offensive actions and seizure of territories. This is the choice that Ukrainians have to make,” Zelensky said. In his opinion, both holding elections and counter-offensive actions at the front require the mobilization of the entire population. As Zelensky pointed out, the country and its residents do not have enough resources to combine them. Coup or resignation: what will the conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny lead to Experts told the details of political intrigues Earlier, on December 22, the newspaper IL Fatto Quotidiano wrote that the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Valery Zaluzhny could bypass President Vladimir Zelensky in the elections. Former special forces officer, Retired Colonel Anatoly Matviychuk said on December 18 that Zaluzhny could try to overthrow Zelensky. On December 10, the Italian publication L'Antidiplomatico suggested that the head of the office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Ermak, if nominated for the post of head of state, could guarantee Zelensky's security after the elections in 2024 On December 7, the former commander of the Polish ground forces, General Waldemar Skrzypczak, called on Zelensky to resign because of the conflicts he caused between Ukrainian military leaders. On December 6, American political scientist John Varoli shared with Izvestia that the US leadership is tired of President Zelensky, who lost in conflict with Russia, so Washington will soon get rid of it and forget about this conflict by the time of the presidential elections in the country. Prior to this, on December 2, it was reported that the trust rating of the Ukrainian population towards Zaluzhny exceeded that of Zelensky. It turned out that the commander-in-chief is trusted by 82% of respondents, while Zelensky is trusted by 72%. Candidate of Political Sciences, Associate Professor of the Department of Political Analysis, Faculty of Public Administration, Moscow State University. M.V. Lomonosov Alexander Konkov expressed the opinion on October 18 that Zelensky is trying, with the help of the West, to find a legitimate reason for canceling the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine in 2024. As the expert said, the main question is not who will go to the presidential elections, but whether voting will take place at all. On September 4, Denis Denisov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, in a conversation with Izvestia, said that Zelensky understands that any elections in the country will result in a loss and loss of power for him, so he and his team are trying to delay them as much as possible. Earlier, on August 28, Zelensky announced that he was ready to run for a second term if elections were held in Ukraine in 2024. At the same time, he mentioned that holding elections during martial law is prohibited, but in theory this is possible if the parliament supports the appropriate changes in legislation, the West provides financial support, and international observers go “into the trenches.” Zelensky was elected to the post of head of state in the spring 2019. Ukraine has been under martial law since February 2022. Under him, presidential elections are prohibited, but if parliament supports the relevant legislative changes, elections are possible.

He also emphasized that the topic is truly dangerous, since all progressive humanity understands that the more weapons and ammunition sent to the theater of war, the more destruction and casualties. According to State Duma deputy Sultan Khamzaev, if the European Union sends peacekeepers to Ukraine, this will mean a direct conflict between NATO and Russia. “All Western politicians must be aware of what they say, as well as what they do . You need to focus on this. Russia will defend its sovereignty in all possible ways - firmly, fundamentally,” Duma TV quoted him as saying for Izvestia. “A bloodthirsty atmosphere of war reigns among EU politicians” Vice-Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament Dora Duro - about the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO, the consequences of the expansion of the alliance and the conflict in Ukraine Earlier that day, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that the European Union is close to discussing the issue sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. He drew attention to the fact that a year ago EU countries discussed whether it was possible to send lethal weapons to Kyiv. He pointed out that both then and now Budapest said “no,” but the West also “hesitated.” Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed on Friday that this discussion is potentially dangerous. He also added that such decisions should be made taking into account the opinions of both sides. On March 5, the Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament, László Kever, said that NATO and EU countries can be considered full participants in the Ukrainian conflict, since they supply weapons to Kyiv. At the same time, he emphasized that the North Atlantic Alliance and the European Union are not directly fighting in Ukraine. Earlier, on February 27, Orban said that the Hungarian authorities are alarmed by the continuous supply of weapons to Ukraine and fear that one of the European countries will send their military there. According to him, recently “the whole of Europe is sliding step by step towards war.” Prior to this, on February 25, the head of the office of the Prime Minister of Hungary, Gergely Gulyas, recalled that Budapest advocates resolving the conflict in Ukraine peacefully and calls on states to refrain from supplies Kyiv weapons. He added that Hungary is under pressure from countries offering arms supplies to Ukraine, but will not change its position. The special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

Thirteen-year-old Yana told the San Francisco Chronicle on February 21 about the problems she faced after moving from Ukraine. A guest in the throat: dissatisfaction with Ukrainian refugees is growing in Poland. Local residents do not like that the settlers are imposing their principles on them. The girl said that she came with her mother to the United States in March 2022 after the start of the conflict. She went to the local Marina Middle School in January, despite the fact that she did not know the language well. According to her, she formed her idea of American schools from what she saw in teenage films and TV series, but in reality everything turned out to be not so romantic like on the screen. Students disrupted lessons with complete impunity, swore at teachers, and jumped on their desks. Later, Yana realized that this is the norm here. The young Ukrainian also faced threats and insults in her direction. She said that during a month of studying, her mobile phone was stolen, after which Yana stopped attending school. Now the girl’s family is asking to transfer her to another school, but local officials are rejecting this request and convincing her to return. On February 19, it was reported that Ukrainian refugees who chose life in Canada now regret their choice. It is noted that many see Canada as a “backward” country in terms of technological developments introduced into everyday life.

A European source told The Guardian reporters about this on the sidelines of the summit on December 14. “Orban was temporarily absent from the meeting room when the Council made a decision on Ukraine, this was agreed upon and done constructively,” the diplomat said. At the same time, another source emphasized that Orban “ was aware of what decision would be made.” Earlier in the day, Orban said that Hungary considered the start of negotiations with Ukraine on its accession to the EU to be a bad decision. According to him, Budapest does not want to participate in the discussion of Kyiv’s entry into the organization. They were banned: Austria, following Hungary and Slovakia, did not want to see Ukraine in the EU. In Vienna, they believe that Kyiv should not receive privileges compared to other candidates. The EU summit takes place on December 14-15 in Brussels. At it, European leaders decided to approve the start of negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova on their entry into the union. At the same time, Orban stated on December 13 that Hungary intends to prevent EU members from making a terrible mistake and allowing Ukraine to join the organization. He stressed that he would block such a decision. On November 29, EC head Ursula von der Leyen said that Kyiv had fulfilled almost all the requirements set by the EU to begin negotiations on joining the union.

"May 2023","Artillerymen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) in several directions again began to use a Soviet-caliber 152 mm gun instead of the NATO 155 mm, military expert, former lieutenant colonel of the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) Andrey Marochko reported on May 2, citing Russian intelligence data. “In Kupyansky, in the Krasnoliman and Donetsk directions there has been a decrease in the use of Western 155-mm guns and an increase in the use of Soviet 152-mm artillery,” TASS quotes him. At the same time, Marochko noted that in the Kherson and Zaporozhye directions the use of NATO-caliber artillery has become more frequent. Inglorious attempts: Ukrainian counterattacks in Artemovsk failed. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and our units liberated several more blocks. On April 27, it was reported that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were not able to advance due to a lack of weapons, personnel and missiles that could fire at a distance of 150 km. As Oleg Soskin, a former adviser to ex-President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma, noted, “all intelligence services say that Ukraine is not ready.” On April 24, the head of the Kharkov defense forces, Brigadier General Sergei Melnik, pointed out the lack of people and equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He called on international allies to provide more weapons.

"August 20 2023","The counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) was unable to penetrate Russian defenses, and future deliveries of F-16 fighters to Kyiv will not be a “silver bullet”. This was reported by CNBC on August 19. It is noted that despite tanks, artillery and other Western weapons, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have failed to demonstrate a significant breakthrough. “Here in the United States we want results yesterday, but it simply doesn’t work that way when you’re up against such a military strength, like the Russians,” the TV channel quotes Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center for Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. As CNBC points out, the future delivery of American F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv will not be a “silver bullet” for Ukraine, since it will take months , if not years of training for Ukrainian pilots to achieve maximum benefit from the F-16. Only sending fighter jets will not change the situation overnight, the TV channel reports. To the downed pilots: how the supply of F-16s to Kyiv will change the battlefield And what these machines are capable of in the hands of Ukrainian pilots Earlier that day, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said that the supply of F-16s to Ukraine has serious consequences. He noted that Russia views the appearance of fighters of this type in the hands of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a threat to security in the nuclear sphere. According to him, the supply of F-16s to Ukraine is an insane decision, which is being made against the backdrop of awareness of the impasse into which Washington has driven itself. The day before, the commander of the US Air Force (Air Forces) in Europe, General James Hecker, said that strengthened air defense (air defense) ) Russia is capable of resisting F-16 fighters. Also, a member of the House of Representatives, Republican Marjorie Taylor-Green, called the sending of American F-16 fighters to Ukraine a step towards world war. In her opinion, American President Joe Biden “works for Ukraine, and puts America in last place.” In turn, former American intelligence officer Scott Ritter said in a conversation with Izvestia that Ukrainian pilots will not be able to effectively use F-16 fighters. He recalled that Ukrainian pilots have never flown on NATO aircraft before, so they will not be able to use the full potential of such machines. Military expert retired colonel Viktor Litovkin said in an interview with Izvestia on August 18 that the F-16 “will not take root” on Ukraine, this is indicated by many factors. So, the F-16 needs an equipped airfield and a technical and operational unit, where they will prepare the aircraft for takeoff and service them after the flight. In addition, training pilots will take quite a lot of time. On August 17, Reuters reported that the United States approved the transfer of F-16 fighters from Denmark and the Netherlands to Kiev upon completion of training for Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots. White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby said that the United States together with their partners, they are exploring the possibility of transferring American F-16 fighters to Ukraine from third countries. At the same time, a combat veteran, first-rank reserve captain Vasily Dandykin, in a conversation with Izvestia, shared that Ukraine will probably not receive the American F-16 fighters promised by Western countries. 16 in the fall or winter of this year, since it has problems with personnel training. He also noted that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are not yet ready to host such “rather capricious aircraft”, since there is no road infrastructure and other support. On August 13, the Ukrainian publication UNIAN reported that the United States is not transferring F-16 fighters to Ukraine, since the Russian Armed Forces will be able to shoot down them with ease, which in turn will demonstrate the ineffectiveness of NATO doctrines and the futility of gigantic financial investments in military affairs. The newspaper Politico wrote on August 4 that the insufficient level of knowledge of English among Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots turned out to be a problem for their training on F-16 fighters. Western countries have strengthened military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to the aggression of Ukrainian troops.

The head of the Russian delegation at the negotiations in Vienna on military security and arms control, Konstantin Gavrilov, told Izvestia on Friday, December 15. The diplomat said that during the final meeting of the OSCE forum on security cooperation, Moscow made it clear that the use of airfields in Poland, Slovakia and Romania by Ukrainian pilots will be perceived as the participation of these countries in the conflict in Ukraine.

"19 December 2023","Russia protects its soldiers by destroying the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) with artillery. This was stated on December 18 by a former officer of the national battalion “Aidar” (banned in the Russian Federation) and special forces of the Ukrainian army, Major Igor Lapin, in an interview with the Ukrainian TV channel “Direct.” “Arta is dismantling our borders into molecules. If somewhere the Armed Forces of Ukraine are still left, they heard automatic or machine-gun fire somewhere, they again finish off everything they can with artillery,” the military complained. According to Lapin, the infantry of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation moves forward only after the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is liquidated with a hail of shells. The major reported with alarm that the Russian army had always had a “total advantage” in the density of artillery fire and was unlikely to ever lose this advantage. In addition, the officer complained that the situation of Ukrainian soldiers was aggravated by a shortage of shovels and picks to build fortifications. He also envied Russia’s powerful construction equipment, with which the Russian Armed Forces “do not spend half a day digging trenches by hand.” Lapin also pointed out the connection between the problem of the Ukrainian army and inadequate planning on the part of the country’s President Vladimir Zelensky. “This is a man (Zelensky. - Ed. .), who voiced the thesis “Our strategy is tactics.” And you expect him to tell you about some kind of strategic plan? His strategy is tactics! He’s too busy to think,” Lapin said indignantly. Positions and sacrifices: the president assessed the actions of Ukrainians in Krynki Kyiv is losing elite units in attempts to hold a bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnieper Earlier, on December 15, Ukrainian war correspondent Andrei Tsaplienko said that the Ukrainian Armed Forces spent too many resources on a counteroffensive that did not bring results. In addition, he noted that the Ukrainian army lacks human resources. In particular, the military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine located on the line of combat contact are greatly exhausted, the military correspondent noted. On the same day, CNN, citing estimates from Western intelligence services, reported that Ukraine could suffer defeat in the conflict with Russia by the summer of 2024 if it loses the support of the United States and their allies. The TV channel also noted that while the Armed Forces of Ukraine are forced to conserve ammunition, Russian troops are “returning fire with an intensity five to seven times greater than what Ukrainian forces are capable of.” On December 14, the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of Russia, Sergei Naryshkin, stated that that the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces turned out to be a complete failure. The Kiev regime did not achieve any success on the battlefield, but at the same time suffered sensitive, partly irreparable losses in manpower and military equipment, the head of the SVR clarified. On the same day, former NATO Commander-in-Chief James Stavridis pointed out that the US government was disappointed in Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky due to the failed counter-offensive operation. Russian President Vladimir Putin during the “Results of the Year” said that since the start of the Ukrainian counter-offensive, Russia has destroyed 747 tanks and 2.3 thousand armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces of various classes. Ukraine produces almost nothing, everything is brought to it, but someday this will end. As Putin said back on October 15, the Ukrainian counter-offensive has completely failed.

He emphasized that American tanks are driving through Russian territory. “It’s bad, but they drive until a certain point, and then they burn. We will continue to destroy them,” added the Kremlin representative, notes Gazeta.Ru. According to him, the West is playing with fire, discussing the need to send its soldiers to Ukraine. Discussions of this kind risk leading to “degradation of the situation,” Peskov concluded.

One of them is related to suspicions of “kidnapping Ukrainian children and transporting them to Russia,” the second is related to “deliberate attacks” on civilian infrastructure. However, the publication clarified that legal proceedings are unlikely, since the ICC cannot consider cases in absentia, although judges can issue arrest warrants. The ICC operates in accordance with the Rome Statute of 1998, which was developed with the participation of Russia. Initially, Moscow signed this document, but in 2016 it refused to be a party to it.

Russian President Vladimir Putin stated this during an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson, the recording of which was published on the TCN (Tucker Carlson Network) website on February 9. “I said that let them think about how to do it with dignity. There are options, but if there is a desire,” the president said. However, Putin noted, NATO countries still expect Russia’s defeat in the Ukrainian conflict, but this is “impossible by definition.” “Until now they were making noise, shouting that it was necessary achieve strategic defeat of Russia, defeat on the battlefield. Now, apparently, the realization is coming that this is not easy to do, if at all possible. In my opinion, this is impossible by definition. This will never happen,” the Russian leader emphasized. In addition, Putin told Carlson that Russia is still ready for dialogue with Western countries, which will put an end to the armed conflict. “It seems to me that now awareness of this has come to those who control power in the West.

Swiss scales: the Russian Federation does not see Bern as a mediator in negotiations with Ukraine What the confederation is seeking and who in Europe is ready for dialogue with Moscow Before this, Putin said in an interview that Russia and Ukraine will sooner or later come to an agreement and relations between peoples will be restored.

Republicans hope the fight over Ukraine funding, which Democrats are pushing, could provide leverage as they look to tighten access to asylum for those entering the U.S. Yesterday , December 3, former national security assistant to the 45th American President Donald Trump, US Permanent Representative to the UN John Bolton said that the Ukrainian conflict could end in victory for the Russian Federation if the United States switches all its forces from Kyiv to the Middle East. According to him, Russia's diplomatic victory is also causing growing concern. A group of strange people: at what point will the EU start saving in Ukraine? And at whose expense is the association trying to increase military aid to Kiev? In mid-November, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, during a visit to Kiev, announced that the United States would provide Ukraine with a new tranche of military aid worth $100 million. In this regard, the Russian Ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, called the new package of military assistance to Kyiv a calming pill. He pointed out that the situation at the front and in the Ukrainian government is on the verge of collapse. On November 17, Biden signed a bill to finance the work of the country’s government without assistance to Ukraine. The temporary funding bill has been approved by both chambers of the US Congress and also does not provide assistance to Israel. The draft was drawn up by Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson (Republican from Louisiana). In the same month, Russian President Vladimir Putin recalled that Moscow had never abandoned peace negotiations on Ukraine. According to him, any military action is always a tragedy and it is necessary to “think about how to stop this tragedy.” Share: if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1615132'); } else { document.addEventListener('recommendationRunInit', function() { if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1615132'); } }); }",2023-12-20
"10 May 2023","Russia values its relations with Serbia and hopes that Belgrade will not join the Western “mainstream” in relation to Moscow. This was stated on Wednesday, May 10, by the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov in an interview with the Serbian TV channel ATV. “We value our relations with Belgrade very much. These are relations that are not only based on the principles of mutual benefit, they have very long historical roots, spiritual roots, we are very close, we are relatives. But we also know that they are under even more pressure than the Republika Srpska,” he said. The spokesman noted the political wisdom and resilience of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, as he has to find delicate balances. In addition, Peskov recalled that that the Serbs are our friends and brothers, and they are our strategic partners. However, according to him, Moscow will not prevent Belgrade from building its relations with Washington and Brussels. “Serbia is a sovereign country, and we have nothing against (the development of its relations with the West - Ed.). The main thing for us is not to be like the Westerners, because they believe that if a country is going to be friends with them, it must hate Russia. We are against this, we believe that nothing, no cooperation with Western, European and other countries should be an obstacle to the further development of our relations,” concluded the press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation. Evil is no longer enough: Serbia is forced to react to the decision of the Council of Europe Loud statements from Belgrade alone are not enough. The day before, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on the Happy TV channel that upon arrival in the country, Western representatives begin the conversation not with greetings, but with calls for anti-Russian sanctions. He added that in response to such calls he wishes “all the best,” emphasizing that the essence of the proposal is clear to him. On April 28, the Foreign Policy Committee of the European Parliament adopted Vladimir Bilchik’s report on Serbia for 2022, in which he, in particular, criticized Serbia’s reluctance impose sanctions against Russia. Russian Ambassador to Serbia Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko said that the MEP’s report is an interference in the internal affairs of the republic. On April 25, Serbian MP from the Dveri party Ivan Kostic told Izvestia that soon the entire Serbian public will openly support Russia’s policy towards Ukraine. On April 20, Vucic said on the Prva TV channel that the conflict in Ukraine showed the whole world the hypocrisy of the West. NATO representatives regularly call on Serbia to become part of the alliance, since, in their opinion, Russia will put everyone at risk, he added. On March 24, the press secretary of the Russian President, Dmitry Peskov, spoke on the topic of pressure from Western countries on states friendly to Russia. Thus, Moscow is sympathetic to the actions of its allies regarding the ban on circumventing anti-Russian sanctions. According to the press secretary, partner countries themselves talk about the threats they receive from Western countries for their reluctance to introduce restrictive measures against the Russian Federation. Western countries have increased sanctions pressure on Russia amid a special operation to protect Donbass, which began on February 24, 2022. The decision to hold it was made after the situation in the region worsened due to Ukrainian shelling.

He explained this by the fact that Xi Jinping is currently busy with a visit to Moscow. “I know the Americans’ reaction to the possibility of contact. The Americans said: “We understand that Mr. Chairman of the People’s Republic of China is busy now, busy with a visit to Russia.” That's what I think he's doing. I don’t think that today or tomorrow there will be any conversation with Kiev,” Ushakov said. He added that he doesn’t even know whether the Chinese side confirmed the fact of possible negotiations between Xi Jinping and Zelensky. “In this context, this fact of possibility is completely unimportant conversation,” he answered the question of whether possible negotiations between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders are important to Moscow in terms of resolving the conflict in Ukraine. Earlier that day, the Financial Times, citing a source, wrote that the Chairman of the PRC may call the President of Ukraine after his visit to Moscow. Ninth Chinese: why Xi Jinping came to Russia Experts are already calling the visit historic and believe that the chances of Beijing’s peacekeeping initiative in Ukraine are growing.

"16 April 2023","The Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Economic Relations of Hungary, Péter Szijjártó, accused the European Commission of “Hungarian-phobic behavior.” A video of his appearance on Hungarian television on April 16 appeared on his Facebook page (owned by the Meta company, which is extremist and banned in Russia). “I think it’s time for Brussels to stop Hungarian-phobic behavior, it’s clear that they are suffering from the fact that cannot interfere in Hungarian processes, cannot influence the decisions of the Hungarian people... In fact, the situation is that Brussels has problems not with specific cases, but with the Hungarian will in general,” Szijjártó said. He noted that the words about violations rights in Hungary seem ridiculous to him, after pension reform was adopted in France without a parliamentary vote, and in Germany the election law was changed by a simple majority. He also commented on Brussels' claims regarding the participation of Hungarian politicians on university boards of trustees, calling them false problems. “The dispute between the European Commission and Hungary is not really about legal facts. If we were talking about them, we would receive a list, study it properly, consider it, discuss it, of course, and accept what we consider legal. But that’s not what this is about,” says Szijjártó. He emphasized that the problem is that Brussels is unable to accept the will of the Hungarian people, who chose a right-wing, nationally oriented, Christian-democratic, patriotic government. “In Hungary, such a government has power for thirteen years. We didn’t win this in a lottery, people clearly expressed their will in the elections, but in Brussels they simply cannot digest and swallow this, that a right-wing, Christian-Democratic government can be successful,” he concluded. Harmful independence: why Americans are punishing Hungary Viktor Orban is confident that Ukraine is costing the EU countries too much. Representatives of this country have already expressed points of view that differ from those of other countries. In particular, on April 14, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called Ukraine a non-existent country in financial terms. In his opinion, as soon as the United States and European countries stop supporting it, the conflict will be over. The Hungarian politician emphasized that the EU is spending tens of billions of dollars on maintaining Ukraine and this cannot continue indefinitely. Communications Director of the ruling Fidesz party Istvan Hollick noted on April 12 that the Hungarian authorities will not abandon their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, despite pressure from the US. Hollick added that the Orban government has been in power for 12 years and, in his words, the United States should have already realized that “they achieve nothing with such pressure actions.” Western countries have increased their military support for Kyiv against the backdrop of a special operation to protect Donbass. Moscow has repeatedly condemned the supply of weapons to Ukraine. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues.

Meanwhile, retired US Marine Corps intelligence officer and military analyst Scott Ritter said on January 20 that it is unlikely that Western countries will be able to transfer to Ukraine a weapon that could turn the tide of hostilities in Kyiv’s favor, despite the desperate situation of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky. US House of Representatives member Marjorie Taylor Greene expressed the opinion on January 19 that Washington is desperately seeking new funding to continue the Ukrainian conflict. Then Columnist Josh Rogin, in an article for The Washington Post, wrote that the prospects for the adoption of a compromise agreement on Ukraine and migration policy by the US House of Representatives this month are close to zero, and “even less in the coming months.” On January 18, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said that the United States will approve the allocation of another aid package to Kyiv “any day” as soon as congressmen agree on resolving the issue on the country’s southern border. On the same day, Biden said that the issue of allocating further aid to Ukraine from the United States rests on the minority in Congress. According to him, “the majority of Republicans” are in favor of helping Kyiv. At the same time, the leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, after a meeting with Biden, said that the chances of reaching an agreement on financing Ukraine in the American Congress exceed 50%. In turn, Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the US Senate next week could begin work on Biden's request for national security purposes, including assistance to Ukraine. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller stated that it is impossible to provide assistance to Ukraine bypassing the US Congress. Political scientist , senior lecturer at MGIMO University of the Russian Foreign Ministry Alexey Zudin said in an interview with Izvestia that military assistance to Ukraine from the United States will continue, but will be reduced. It is noted that support will continue even if agreements are not reached within the American establishment. On January 16, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States does not have a “magic pot” from which it could finance Ukraine without coordinating requests in Congress. Strategic Communications Coordinator in the White House National Security Council, John Kirby indicated that Washington is not yet preparing new packages of military assistance to Ukraine due to the lack of budgetary funds for this. In turn, Assistant to the US President for National Security Jake Sullivan said that the White House will attempt to achieve the allocation of American congress of assistance to Kyiv in the coming weeks. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg believes that the US Congress will still be able to approve a new aid package to Ukraine, even despite the existing disagreements. On the suspension of supplies of American weapons and military equipment to Kyiv due to Washington’s lack of budgetary funds Kirby announced on January 11. On January 3, he noted that the American aid package sent to Kiev on December 27 would be the last for now. This aid package worth up to $250 million included weapons and equipment. Prior to this, on December 6, Republicans blocked the Senate from considering the White House's request for funds for Ukraine, Israel and other needs. In exchange for concessions on the bill, they demanded changes in approaches to border security. On December 10, the White House announced that the United States had $1 billion left to replenish its own arms reserves, which were depleted due to regular deliveries to Ukraine. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which began on February 24, 2022 years after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

In particular, the dispute raises the issue of replenishing Ukraine's artillery reserves. The publication also reported that Hungary blocked the signing of a common statement by the European Union (EU) countries, timed to coincide with the second anniversary of the start of a special military operation in Ukraine. According to the agency, Budapest doubted the appropriateness of some points in the joint statement, but whether this could have become a reason for blocking it cannot be said for sure. On February 21, The Guardian newspaper published the results of a study, according to which only 10% of Europeans believe that Ukraine will be able to win the conflict, while twice as many Europeans believe that victory will be Russia's. 17 thousand respondents from 12 countries took part in the survey. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022.

This was reported by the Ukrainian analytical portal “Word and Deed” on Thursday, October 12. With reference to data from the Ukrainian National Bank and the Trading Economics portal, the portal indicated that Ukraine ranks last in the top ten in the world unemployment ranking, which mainly includes countries in Africa and the Middle East , including the Republic of Congo and Palestine.

A decline in the birth rate, combined with the migration of Ukrainians and their mortality, could reduce the country's population from about 37 million to 26 million in ten years, Ella Libanova, head of the Ukrainian Institute of Demography and Social Research, told Focus. However, she emphasized that before the conflict, the birth rate had increased by Ukraine also did not ensure stable development of the population, where there should be at least 210 children per 100 women. In 2021, this value was 116, and in 2022, the number of births decreased by another 25%.

"January 2024","Ukraine was unable to live up to the West's hopes in the conflict with Russia. Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte stated this on January 2 in an interview with LRT. “We were hoping for a completely different result than we have today. And, unfortunately, this means that we have to start counting on the fact that the scenario will not develop as we wanted at the beginning and before Kyiv’s offensive actions,” she shared. Shimonyt noted that Western countries “took the situation lightly "" They hoped that funding and a flow of weapons would help Ukraine, “and during this time we would all become stronger and feel more secure.” But this, according to the prime minister, did not happen. She also said that it is more likely that 2024 will be difficult from a military and political point of view, since European countries, in her opinion, are “entering a very uncomfortable political cycle.” In conclusion, Simonyte added that enthusiasts, confident that Ukraine would quickly achieve victory, “were hasty in their assessments.” With fear and doubt: the West is not sure about the future of Ukraine The French President hinted at the US and EU fatigue from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Earlier in the day, former Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl said that the West had changed its position regarding Ukraine and would no longer waiting for Kyiv's victory.

On January 2, former US Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder said that Ukraine could lose to the Russian Federation in the first half of 2024. In his opinion, Kyiv may lose Washington’s help, which will contribute to the defeat of the Ukrainian side. Earlier, on December 21, the American newspaper The Nation wrote that Kyiv’s victory is unlikely, so the United States and European countries should bring Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to the peace negotiations table.

The commandant of the Kyiv region, Ruslan Oleynik, spoke about this in an interview with the TSN agency on Sunday, December 31. “Their [checkpoints] goal is to identify and prevent the movement of sabotage and reconnaissance groups, extremists, terrorists, wanted persons, smuggling of weapons, ammunition and explosives. substances,” Oleinik explained. Such counter-sabotage activities, according to the commandant, will last from December 28 to January 6. They provide for the inspection of vehicles and personal property. “For example, if police officers at the base check a person and see that the person is wanted as a draft evader or has not restored his credentials in the TCC and SP, then, of course, in this case, the employees of the territorial center staff will issue summonses to such citizens,” Oleynik explained.

"June 5 2023","The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will run out of manpower before they run out of weapons. This opinion was expressed by German political scientist Wolf Merkel. He pointed out that the problem of the Kyiv regime lies in the number of troops and population, and not in the amount of supplied weapons. According to Merkel, the preponderance could lead to the fact that there will be no one to fight for Ukraine with Western weapons in their hands. “Since we proceed from the fact that NATO will not directly intervene in the conflict with the participation of its troops, the question of the size of the Russian and Ukrainian armies, will probably be decisive,” he said during the June 2 episode of Der Spiegel on YouTube. Air raids: Russian Aerospace Forces struck Ukrainian airfields The main target was aircraft carrying long-range missiles from NATO countries, experts say. Earlier, on May 31, the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov said that sooner or later Europe will have to think and answer to its people. Why is she pumping arms into Ukraine? The Kremlin spokesman added that European countries are already feeling the negative consequences economically. On May 30, the head of the UK Parliamentary Defense Committee, Tobias Ellwood, called on the government to send Challenger 2 tanks from reserve to Ukraine.

"June 2023","The Supreme Court of the Netherlands made a final decision on Scythian gold ahead of the September 15 deadline. The official representative of the court, Thea Tjerdema, announced this on June 9. “When planning, we always talk about a preliminary date. The Supreme Court may make a decision not only on the specified date, but also later or earlier. In this case it happened earlier. The Supreme Court was able to announce the verdict because it came to a decision earlier than the planned date, that is, September 15,” she told TASS. According to her, on September 15, nothing should be expected in the Scythian gold case. Scythian and the truth: why the court in Amsterdam decided to give Crimean gold to Ukraine And how else can Russia compete for the richest collection Earlier that day, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands announced that the decision of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to transfer the collection of “Scythian gold” to Ukraine remains in force. The report states that after this decision, the Allard Pearson Museum must transfer the artistic values to the state of Ukraine, and not to the Crimean museums. General Director of the Central Museum of Taurida in Simferopol, Andrei Malgin, in a conversation with Izvestia on January 27, called the Advisory decision of the Attorney General of the Netherlands that Scythian gold may be left with Ukraine, unfair and biased. In October 2021, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal ruled on the transfer of Scythian gold into the ownership of Ukraine. In January 2022, the museums of Crimea sent a cassation appeal to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands against the decision to transfer the collection to Ukraine. At the same time, the Crimean parliament Vladimir Konstantinov emphasized that the museums of Crimea were going to seek justice in the case of Scythian gold. He emphasized that in Crimea they regard this decision as an act of international robbery against museums. In the same month, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation began a pre-investigation investigation into the theft of a collection of Scythian gold belonging to four museums on the Crimean peninsula. As noted by the deputy head of the working group on international legal issues at the permanent mission of Crimea to the President of Russia, Alexander Molokhov, officials should have timely registered the collection of Scythian gold as an integral part of the museum fund of the Russian Federation, but this was not done. By Scythian gold we mean exhibits sent to February 2014 to the exhibition “Crimea: Gold and Secrets of the Black Sea” at the Allard Pearson Museum in Amsterdam.

"November 2023","Military expert, retired colonel Anatoly Matviychuk listed on Friday, November 3, the main complaints of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) about the equipment supplied to Kyiv by the West. “Firstly, Western equipment is very complex, and secondly, it is not adapted to the European theater of military operations . Winter is coming, and, according to the experience of the last year of operation, the equipment has already stopped starting. The same American Abrams cannot even climb an ice hill because the clutch slips. Thirdly, they are very capricious to operate; they require tons of spare parts, which are not available in Ukraine,” Matviychuk said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. Tank slaughter: American and German armored vehicles are burning in the Northern Military District zone. In one day, Russian fighters destroyed more than 15 Leopard tanks and 20 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Earlier, on October 22, experts on the portal of the Bavarian newspaper Münchner Merkur indicated that Abrams is much heavier than its Russian counterpart and Soviet-era models , which Ukraine previously used. The Ukrainian military must ensure the tank can cross bridges when deployed, although the tank is too heavy for many bridges. In addition, it has a very high fuel requirement compared to other models. Ensuring a constant supply of it in combat could be a challenge. The military says it will be some time before the Abrams can be sent into combat. Ukraine must first create new supply lines for ammunition and spare parts for them, provide a sufficient number of tankers for Ukrainian soldiers operating these tanks, RT reports. On October 17, a representative of the US Army Europe and Africa Command, Colonel Martin O'Donnell, announced that all the promised supplies would be sent to Ukraine. M1A1 Abrams tanks. He clarified that Washington transferred all 31 units of combat vehicles, NSN reports. In early October, it was reported that the United States supplied outdated Abrams tanks to Ukraine. As American ex-marine Matthew Ho noted at the end of September, the Pentagon is transferring outdated combat vehicles to Ukraine because modern Russian forces can easily intercept the supplied equipment, and the American leadership does not want new tanks to fall into the hands of the Russian Armed Forces. At the end of September, a Russian serviceman with the call sign Zhuk told Izvestia that Russian tanks have several advantages over Abrams. According to him, at least American armored vehicles are heavier, longer and higher in comparison with Russian ones, which allows them to inflict maximum damage.

Then we went to the border together and met with representatives of the Ukrainian government,” RIA Novosti reports his words. He also added that the protesters were offered some solutions, to which they responded negatively. Adamczyk explained that the protest was caused by the actions of Ukraine and the European Union (EU). “The reason for the protests are reasons that lie either on the Ukrainian side of the border or on the EU side. “Lying on the EU side is an agreement signed between the EU and Ukraine, suspending permits for the entry of trucks, which were previously required from Ukrainian drivers,” the minister emphasized. Drowned in the depths: what will the new quarrel between Ukraine and Poland lead to? Experts spoke about the consequences of the conflict. Earlier, on November 6, several dozen Polish carriers began to block automobile checkpoints on the border with Ukraine.

In the afternoon, the blockade of three Polish-Ukrainian border crossings began in Chrebennoy, Dorohusk and Korchev. A few days later, huge queues of trucks accumulated on the border of Ukraine and Poland. One of the queues began from the side of Lublin near the city of Helm. Law enforcement did not allow vehicles into the city to avoid blocking traffic. On November 14, Reuters reported that Kyiv and Warsaw had failed to reach any agreement to end a week-long protest by Polish truckers on the border with Ukraine. On the same day, the Myśl Polska portal stated that there was a transport war between the countries due to the desire of Polish carriers to protect the market from Ukrainian competitors. The next day, the Ukrainian publication Strana.ua reported that the Ukrainian economy was under threat due to carrier strikes on the border with Poland, impeding the movement of trucks. Vice-President of the Association of International Road Carriers of Ukraine Vladimir Balin said that if the strike lasts a few more weeks, the financial year for the country can be considered closed.

"June 14 2023","The US supply of tank shells with depleted uranium to Ukraine will damage the environment and lead to contamination of Ukrainian grain. Official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova stated this on Wednesday, June 14. “For the United States of America, this is apparently not a problem at all. They apparently don’t see this as a problem, because they believe that since they are on another continent, the supply of radioactive substances that will be used in hostilities will not affect them,” Zakharova told RIA Novosti on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International economic forum (SPIEF). In addition, Zakharova noted that the supply and use of depleted uranium shells will primarily affect food produced in Ukraine, including grain. At the same time, grain contaminated with radiation will not be able to be exported, which directly contradicts the statements of Western countries about their commitment to food security, Zakharova noted. “But, apparently, due to the stupidity of those who make such decisions in the Anglo-Saxon world, they believe that this is not theirs.” will affect. Well, that was just the first reaction, because the very grain and the very food that is produced on the territory of Ukraine will also be contaminated. Who will they supply it to if they talk about food security every day?” - she emphasized. Earlier, on June 13, The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House intends to provide Ukraine with tank shells with depleted uranium. According to the publication, the administration of US President Joe Biden agreed to transfer the shells to Kyiv after several weeks of internal debate about what ammunition to equip the Abrams tanks that Washington is transferring to Kiev. A similar decision was previously announced by Great Britain. Thus, on April 25, British Deputy Minister of Defense James Heappie announced that London had supplied Kyiv with thousands of shells for Challenger 2 tanks, including those with depleted uranium. Then he pointed out that all military equipment and ammunition provided by Britain are under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), and the British Ministry of Defense does not monitor where and how they are used. Evil spirits: what is the danger of supplying Ukraine with shells with depleted uranium? And how will Russia respond to the use of weapons with a nuclear component? Later, Deputy Spokesperson of the Secretary-General of the world organization Farhan Haq said that the UN is concerned about the transfer of shells with depleted uranium to Kyiv. Earlier, on March 25, the President of Russia Vladimir Putin warned that the Russian Federation would respond to the use of depleted uranium ammunition if this happened. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of a Russian special operation to protect the Donbass. The decision to launch a special operation was made on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of a worsening situation in the region due to increased shelling by Ukrainian militants.

"30 March 2023","Participants in the “Summit for Democracy” ignore the repression of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). This was announced on Thursday, March 30, by the Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov. According to him, such selectivity contradicts the declared goals of the forum. “The persecution of monks occurs at a time when Washington is holding a “Summit for Democracy”, at which slogans about the need respect for freedom of personality, speech, conscience and religion,” the press service of the Russian diplomatic mission publishes Antonov’s commentary. The head of the department reproached the American authorities and the international community for the lack of response to such flagrant violations. He called on the States to take concrete steps to solve the problem and stop discrimination against Orthodox believers. “If we do this to the Church, we will be lost” Does the UOC have a chance to defend the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Earlier, on March 10, a warning was published on the website of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra that the monks must leave the monastery until March 29, 2023. On the day the ultimatum of the Kyiv regime expired, hundreds of parishioners came to the temple. According to Izvestia, on March 29, about 200 people gathered on the street next to the monastery. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian publication Strana.ua on March 30 published an appeal from the abbot of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, Metropolitan Paul, who said that God will not forgive the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky because of his policy towards the monastery. The day before, former adviser to Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin suggested that the Kyiv regime’s persecution of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) is fraught with the outbreak of a civil war. In turn, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergei Ryabkov said that the department condemns the eviction ministers of the UOC from the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. The minister declared solidarity with those who are in the bosom of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), and also wished strength of spirit, will, firmness in realizing the rightness of the figures of the UOC. The Ministry of Culture of Ukraine on March 21 announced the partial closure of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra due to identified violations. The clergy were given an ultimatum, according to which security forces would be sent to the Lavra to resolve the situation if the monks did not leave the parish. Prior to this, on March 17, the Kremlin said that in this way the Kiev regime had once again demonstrated what Russia is struggling with and what it should stop. In 2022, the Ukrainian authorities intensified actions directed against the UOC. They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” Thus, in December 2022, the SBU opened 50 criminal cases against priests of the UOC.

"December 26 2023","If the Kiev administration announces mobilization, the Ukrainians will not go to the front. This opinion was expressed by the ex-adviser to the former President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin on his YouTube channel on Monday, December 25. He is convinced that the citizens of Ukraine no longer want to fight for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky. “The authorities are Zelensky, the servants of the people, the whole this elite is aimed at continuing “combat operations” by exterminating hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. They decided to recruit another 500 thousand cannon fodder and throw it to the front,” the expert said. In addition, according to Soskin, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are running out of ammunition and weapons provided by Western countries. Reserves have been depleted, and yet new aid packages in states allied to Kyiv have not yet been approved. They are changing gender: what will the mobilization of women in Ukraine lead to? Future soldiers are caught in bars, sanatoriums and gyms. Earlier in the day, former CIA officer Larry Johnson said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who were forcibly sent to the special operation zone, refuse to carry out Zelensky’s orders. According to him, there are more and more signs that the soldiers are opposed to Zelensky and are ignoring his orders, so he is in real trouble. Prior to this, on December 19, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky at a press conference spoke about the military’s proposal in connection with failures at the front to call about 500 thousand more people. He did not confirm the exact figure, since there is no understanding in the country on the issue of military rotations and leaves for active military personnel. Before this, on December 18, The Economist reported about the lack of fighters in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ukrainians are not eager to go to serve, and military registration and enlistment offices are conducting raids in shopping centers and gyms, journalists said. Martial law has been in effect in Ukraine since February 2022. At the same time, Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization. Later, the Verkhovna Rada repeatedly extended its validity. Most men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country.

"22 November 2023","The European Union (EU) strategy on the Ukrainian conflict has failed, Russia will not be defeated, and therefore the EU must move to a new plan of action, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on November 22, speaking in Zurich at the celebration of the 90th anniversary of the Swiss conservative weekly Die Weltwoche. Orban recalled that Hungary condemned Russia’s actions towards Ukraine from the very beginning, but the West’s reaction to them was wrong. “What was our strategy? Ukrainians fight and win at the front, while Russians lose on the battlefield. What is the reality? Ukrainians fight and die. What have we come to? Russia will not lose, and nothing will change in its policies. Therefore, we must face reality. We must move to plan B,” the Hungarian prime minister said. He stressed that the EU does not yet have such a plan, and instead of changing the strategy, Brussels proposes to continue assistance to Kiev. According to Orban, the only way to “stop the senseless loss of life” is an immediate ceasefire and the start of negotiations. Expendable business: Hungary opposed new funding for Ukraine And called for the start of peace negotiations As Gazeta.Ru reported earlier on Wednesday, Orban threatened to block all EU aid to Ukraine, as well as future negotiations on membership in the association, unless the entire strategy is revised support for Kiev. Prior to this, on November 13, Hungary did not support the allocation of €500 million for weapons to Ukraine. Then Orban stated that Hungary would never agree to link the issue of financing Ukraine from the EU budget, as well as its admission into the community, with the return of frozen European funds to Budapest.

"February 2024","Spanish farmers blocked traffic on some of the country's main highways on Tuesday, joining counterparts from other European Union (EU) countries in protesting against high prices and bureaucracy, Reuters reported on February 6. One of Spain's largest farmers' associations, ASAJA, and other associations called for protests with Thursday, February 8, but already on Tuesday many farmers in Spain took to the roads on their tractors. This has led to traffic jams across the country - from Seville and Granada in the south to Girona near the French border, traffic authorities said. ASAJA vice-president Donaciano Dujo told national broadcaster TVE they were ""fed up"". On one of the tractors gathered yesterday in Girona, a banner could be seen reading: “No farmers, no food.” Spanish farmers, like their counterparts in France, Belgium, Italy and Portugal, complain about the growing burden due to European bureaucracy , low prices for their products and rising costs. They argue that rules imposed on EU farmers to protect the environment are making them less competitive. Protesters are therefore calling for a reduction in the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and a food security law that would prohibit anyone in the food chain from selling goods at a lower price. the one for which the goods were purchased, RTVE TV channel reports. Farmers are also in favor of maintaining a reduced tax on diesel fuel for the agricultural sector. In Spain, several local agricultural organizations announced demonstrations against the backdrop of the difficult situation in the industry. January 30 Just a pitchfork: why farmers protested across Europe Green policies, subsidy cuts and competition with Ukraine is among the main problems of French and German farmers. Mass protests by farmers are taking place in almost all EU countries. For example, in France, one of the reasons for the start of demonstrations by local farmers in January was the upcoming increase in the cost of diesel fuel. Farmers are also unhappy with the fall in income as a result of increased imports of agricultural products into the country from Ukraine. In Hungary on February 3, Agriculture Minister István Nagy assured that Hungary will maintain a national ban on imports of agricultural products from Ukraine in order to protect local farmers and ensure that food is in the country comply with EU standards and will not be guided by EC decisions on this topic. In addition, on February 5, the Ministry of Agriculture of Poland wanted to ban the import of Ukrainian sugar into the country and establish a VAT of 8% on vegetable oil from Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine hopes that the European Commission will cancel the right of individual countries to establish such bans, as announced on January 31 by the Prime Minister -Minister of the country Denis Shmygal. In addition to Poland and Hungary, a national ban on the import of Ukrainian agricultural products also applies in Slovakia. The right of states bordering Ukraine to prohibit the import of such products unilaterally was introduced by the European Commission on January 22 to protect local producers. In 2022, the EU allowed Kyiv to supply food to the union countries duty-free , which hit farmers in Hungary, Poland and some other countries.

"February 2024","Losses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) have increased sharply due to a shortage of shells and Russia's overwhelming advantage in artillery. The Polish Gazeta Wyborcza reported this on February 6. “An increasingly noticeable shortage of ammunition is reducing the effectiveness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the field of counter-battery warfare. <…> Ukrainian artillery is forced to save shells and cannot afford to strike at all potential targets,” the material says. Artillerymen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine also note that the lack of shells leads to an increase in losses in the ranks of the defending Ukrainian infantry. A shortage of weapons has arisen in the Ukrainian army mainly due to the delay in supplies from the European Union and the blocking of new military assistance from the United States, journalists recalled.

He positively assessed Brussels' promises to supply Kyiv with a million ammunition, but pointed out the need to realistically assess the possibilities for their production. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said on February 1 that the EC would transfer to Ukraine new tanks, helicopters, air defense systems and 1 million artillery shells by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, in November 2023, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said that the EU would not be able to fulfill its promises to supply Kyiv with 1 million shells by March 2024, which were announced earlier.

"May 29 2023","US President Joe Biden's inept actions in foreign policy have turned Washington into a tool of Kyiv. This opinion was expressed on May 29 by a former employee of the American Congress, geopolitical analyst Brandon Weichert in a material for 19fortyfive. According to him, Biden became directly involved in the Ukrainian conflict, which could escalate into a nuclear war. “Without the strength to end this conflict or lead it, the United States The states have become an instrument of Kyiv and a hostage to the threat of escalation in relations with Moscow,” Weichert noted. The expert added that Biden’s policies have led to disasters in the Middle East and Latin America. In addition, Washington has weakened its position in relations with Beijing.

At the same time, he noted that the United States does not support Ukrainian attacks using NATO weapons deep into Russia. In response to this, the Russian Foreign Ministry on May 26 expressed a note of protest to the US Embassy in Moscow.

CNN reported this on August 2 with reference to a Ukrainian military man who is participating in battles near the village of Staromayorskoye in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). “They stand until their death. I don't understand their motivation. Or what they are fighting for,” the publication reports his words. Journalists note that many units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces storming Russian positions are perplexed why Russian troops are fighting so desperately for every settlement. “All attempts at a counteroffensive have been stopped” Vladimir Putin called the losses of the Ukrainian army Earlier, on July 31, Polish General Roman Polko called the Ukrainian counteroffensive overhyped and greatly exaggerated. He noted that by this time the actions of Ukrainian militants were limited due to problems with training, as well as a lack of aviation and artillery.

"14 February 2024","Foreign trips of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky may be related to the desire to coordinate military assistance for the country. Political scientist Dmitry Zhuravlev expressed this opinion on Wednesday, February 14. “Zelensky has two tasks. The first is to extend military and financial assistance, to create the illusion that it is Ukraine that wants peace, not Russia. The second is to clarify London’s position regarding the replacement of Zelensky himself with another president. He needs to enlist the support of European capitals,” the specialist said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. According to Zhuravlev, a change in the current head of state today seems quite real. But Zelensky still has a chance to retain his post, he noted. “He is trying to find support for himself personally and to quarrel with those who want to remove him, because the final decision on who to replace Zelensky has not yet been made. Of course, this won’t help him stay forever, but at least it will allow him to delay his departure,” the political scientist concluded.

Earlier, on February 12, Bloomberg reported that the Ukrainian leader will visit Western European countries to speed up the process of sending military aid to the Kyiv regime. Zelensky plans to make a “tour of the capitals of Western Europe as part of the Munich Security Conference,” RT reports. Prior to this, on February 8, US President Joe Biden emphasized that the conflict in Ukraine is at a critical point due to the reduction in support from Western countries, which led by the United States should increase assistance. On February 5, Zelensky noted that military operations are in a state of stagnation and Western countries are to blame for this, which are delaying arms supplies. According to him, it is not enough for the Ukrainian army to receive only shells; it also needs military equipment. On February 1, all 27 leaders of the European Union (EU) member countries at a summit in Brussels agreed to allocate an additional €50 billion as part of a support package for Ukraine from the union budget. At the same time, the Politico newspaper called this aid package a pittance. The newspaper cited data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which estimated Ukraine's financing deficit this year alone at more than $40 billion. The special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

According to him, he would promise one of the presidents of these two countries “a lot of money,” and would tell the other that the other side would not receive the finances. In October of the same year, the former US leader said that it would be the right thing for Ukraine to hand over to Russia those regions of the republic where the local population speaks Russian. He noted that he would be able to negotiate a similar deal with Kiev, which, according to him, would give the Ukrainian side the opportunity to preserve the state. Later, on January 17 this year, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky expressed the opinion that the former American president’s plan would lead to the loss Kiev of its territories.

This was pointed out on Monday, June 12, by the head of the foreign policy service of the European Union (EU), Josep Borrell. “I think that he [Russian President Vladimir Putin] is waiting for the results of the American elections.

According to the politician, the conflict will end quickly if the former President of the United States of America, Republican Donald Trump, comes to power in Washington. Prior to this, in mid-May, Vice President of the Washington-based Eurasian Center Earl Rasmussen, in a conversation with Izvestia, shared his opinion that Trump tried to restore relations between the United States and Russia, but he was unable to achieve this due to the flourishing corruption in the American intelligence services - the FBI and CIA, which were politically biased towards Moscow. Trump himself stated back in October 2022 that rhetoric The government of the current US President became the reason for the start of the Russian special military operation in Ukraine. He pointed out that the conflict might not have taken place if he had been in the presidency.

"12 April 2023","Ukraine has the only chance for a successful counter-offensive. The former director of the Royal Institute of Defense Studies, Michael Clarke, said this on April 12. “The West risks war fatigue if the conflict ends in simply an even greater stalemate. It won't do anyone any good. So in a sense, Ukrainians only have one chance. They must do everything right,” he told Sky News. According to him, Ukraine has formed about 16 new brigades for the offensive, that is, it has about 90-100 thousand troops at its disposal. Clark noted that there is no sign of an offensive starting in the coming days, nor is there any clarity on where it will happen. “Russia thinks they will be used in the south because they dug trenches like there was no tomorrow in the Zaporozhye region. Obviously, the Russians think that the Ukrainians will come to the south, and many people think this is a good idea,” the expert said. “Berlin is pumping up the Kiev regime with deadly weapons systems” Russian Ambassador to Germany Sergei Nechaev on the supply of tanks, aircraft to Ukraine and concealing inconvenient facts about the Nord Stream explosions Earlier that day, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that Kiev has the ability to attack .

Danilov added that some of the published information is not a secret and can be found in open sources. A day earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal said that the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces could begin in the summer, and not in the spring, as previously planned. He explained this by the lack of pressure from the West and the need to fully prepare the Ukrainian army. The leak of two large batches of secret Pentagon documents became known on April 6. We are talking about about 100 documents that relate to Kyiv’s combat capabilities, NATO support and the vulnerability of the Ukrainian army.

In addition, Kyiv is gradually inclined to send people with mental illnesses, as well as the disabled and previously unfit for service, to the front. Systemic with battle: the Ukrainian Federal Military Units are trying to replenish the attacking units with recruits. The decrease in the activity of Ukrainian forces in the Zaporozhye direction can be explained by the rotation of units. Earlier, on September 9, the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Human Rights Dmitry Lubinets submitted to the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) of the country a proposal to cancel the status of “ limited use."" As an argument, he mentioned frequent violations with the issuance of certificates that do not correspond to reality. Prior to this, on September 3, it became known that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense had issued an order according to which men with limited fitness for military service would be called up. On August 30, Polish volunteer Slawomir Wysocki, periodically delivering humanitarian aid to Ukraine, spoke about the terrible situation of the army. According to him, due to huge losses, the fighters have no desire to fight, which is why they have to organize raids on conscripts. Secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Alexei Danilov said on August 26 that additional mobilization would most likely be announced in the country. Back at the end of June in Ukraine the list of citizens subject to mobilization has been expanded. This law legalized the mobilization of citizens whose wife, husband or parents have the first or second group of disability, if they have other able-bodied relatives. Martial law came into force in Ukraine in February 2022, while at the same time the country has a law on general mobilization.

On August 20, the German newspaper Die Welt wrote that Ukraine needs to mobilize 3 million citizens to win the conflict. In his opinion, this conflict will not end with the help of “neither sanctions, nor drones, nor missiles,” but can only be resolved with a superiority in manpower. On August 15, the speaker of the Ukrainian border service, Andrei Demchenko, said that many men registered in the military are trying to leave the country using fake documents, and increased control will help stop more such cases. Therefore, in Ukraine, under martial law, more careful control will be established over all men of military age leaving the country.

The Euractiv portal reported this on February 20, with reference to a member of the National Assembly. As Ivaylo Mirchev from the ruling PP-DB bloc (the “Continue Change” and “Democratic Bulgaria” parties) said, the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense is to blame for the current situation. “Bulgaria can help a lot Ukraine, but this is delayed due to the fact that the administration of the Ministry of Defense is not working optimally,” he noted. He recalled that parliament supported the decision on armored personnel carriers almost three months ago; until now, the port has not been able to transport a hundred armored personnel carriers from Sofia to Ruse (city on the Danube River). The reason for the delay was that Sofia did not check whether NATO allies could finance transportation, he concluded. Earlier, on February 2, it was reported that Bulgaria transferred 100 decommissioned armored vehicles to Ukraine. Prior to this, on January 17, the head of the Bulgarian Defense Ministry Todor Tagarev said that the delay in the delivery of armored vehicles was due to the fact that the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense could not find sponsors who were supposed to help with delivery.

According to N-TV, Greubel emphasized at the annual meeting of Metro shareholders that the company’s board of directors does not make frivolous decisions and regularly analyzes the situation. Moscow's decisions to transfer control of a number of foreign companies to the state in response to the illegal expropriation of Russian assets abroad strengthen the company's confidence that fulfilling its obligations to Russia is in the interests of the network and its shareholders, he said.

"19 April 2023","South Korea can expand support for Ukraine and go beyond humanitarian and economic assistance, said the country's President Yoon Seok-yeol. This is the first time he has signaled a change in position on military support for Kyiv, Reuters writes April 19. In an interview with Reuters ahead of his state visit to the United States next week, Mr. Yoon said his government was studying how to help defend and rebuild Ukraine. He compared the situation to how South Korea received international aid during the 1950-1953 Korean War. It was the first time Seoul had said it was willing to provide weapons to Ukraine, more than a year after it ruled out providing lethal aid. A key US ally and a major producer of artillery ammunition, South Korea has so far tried to avoid confrontation with Russia over its companies operating there and Moscow's influence over North Korea. “I believe there will be no limits on the amount of support for defense and reconstruction.” a country that has been illegally invaded under both international and domestic law,” the South Korean president said. Yoon plans to visit Washington next week to attend a summit with US President Joe Biden to mark the 70th anniversary of the two countries’ alliance. “Leopard” and other animals: what weapons Ukraine has already received Kyiv is preparing a big offensive, experts made predictions On April 12, it became known that the administration of US President Joe Biden signed a contract with South Korea to receive half a million 155-mm shells on credit.

"July 2023","The US decision to provide cluster munitions as military aid to Ukraine has shocked the coalition, which is seeking a ban on the use of such weapons. Deputy Chairman of the Board of the Organization Paul Hannon spoke about this on July 7. According to him, this step will entail numerous casualties among the civilian population both during use and after a while, and in addition, will aggravate the “large-scale contamination of Ukraine with explosive remnants and landmines.” “States parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions must oppose any transfer or use of these weapons,” Hannon concluded. “They want people to not be able to live here. The mines will wait for their victims for years to come.” Izvestia visited the front line in the Seversky direction and talked with the soldiers fighting there. The use of cluster shells is prohibited by the convention of August 1, 2010, which was signed by 123 countries, but ratified by only 110.

Moreover, two members of Congress have developed a bill banning the export of cluster munitions. Biden himself said that the supply of cluster munitions became necessary due to the reduction in the arsenal of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). According to him, this is a temporary measure. US Presidential National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on July 7 that Kyiv will receive cluster munitions and “will not remain unarmed” while Washington increases production of other shells for future deliveries.

"10 April 2023","Even after the fact that the United States was spying on Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky was revealed, control over his actions will not be lifted. Most likely, in connection with reports of a planned counter-offensive by Ukraine, control over it will only be strengthened. Political analyst Alexander Asafov expressed this opinion on Monday, April 10. “We see how the leaked Pentagon documents are no longer challenged on the merits, criticizing only some points. Apparently, we are witnessing such a bizarre mixture of reality and fiction. The fact that the Americans were following Zelensky is a funny fact, which suggests that there is no trust in him at all,” Asafov said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. He admitted that the United States fears that the head of Ukraine may go on some uncontrollable and unexpected steps, and therefore are forced to double-check his actions. At the same time, the disclosure of the fact of surveillance will have little effect on relations between the two countries, the expert believes. “Although it will be unpleasant for Zelensky, control over him will only be strengthened. The offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine must take place according to the American plan, which means that the United States must control all directions of Ukrainian policy, including the actions of the president,” he concluded.

According to him, Zelensky is given tasks by Washington, and then the progress of their execution is simply monitored, writes Pravda.Ru. At the same time, according to the expert, the Ukrainian leader “as a creative person” can sometimes introduce some nuances into certain operations on his own. The day before, April 9, CNN reported that the United States spies on friendly countries, including Ukraine, Israel and South Korea . It was noted that Washington was collecting information about the shortcomings of Ukraine’s weapons, air defense (air defense), as well as the number of battalions, the 360 TV channel reported. As the TV channel reported, this is confirmed by some genuine secret documents from the Pentagon (the headquarters of the US Department of Defense), which were leaked online earlier.

There are ideas that are in tune with our approaches, such as the Chinese initiative,” she said in an interview with TASS, answering the question whether the proposed peace plans contain corresponding ideas. Zakharova also emphasized that in Russia she is grateful to every country, every state or to every public figure who propose possible settlement options and want to be useful in this direction. Also, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry called the main problem that the proposals are blocked by the Kyiv regime.

In addition, they mention the military of the United States and Great Britain, which “have been directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine for a long time.” “Today, given the colossally low rating of Scholz himself and his coalition called “Traffic Light,” we can conclude that he is already in the frying pan. Yesterday he says one thing, today he says something else. He needs to decide whether to be smart or beautiful: either one or the other. In other words, either they are involved in the conflict or they are not. <...> I think that Mr. Scholz does not have much time left as chancellor, until the next elections, taking into account his unclear policies, which led Germany to complete collapse: economic, and also political. That is why Scholz is looking for who to shift the arrows to in this case - to [French President Emmanuel] Macron or to [British Prime Minister Rishi] Sunak. It’s obvious that he’s doing it poorly,” Belik believes. According to the deputy, there is nothing surprising in Scholz’s behavior, however, Moscow has its own goals and objectives during the special military operation (SVO) to protect Donbass, which will certainly be fulfilled. We ourselves are not local: Scholz went to Washington to demand money from the United States for Ukraine. Previously, the German Chancellor was reproached for indecisiveness, now he has become almost Kyiv’s main assistant. Earlier, on February 28, Scholz said that Germany would not send its soldiers to Ukraine, and NATO will not be a party to the conflict. He noted that Germany does not want the conflict to escalate into a confrontation between NATO and Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron announced on February 26 the possibility of sending Western troops to Ukraine. His words were not supported in Paris. The possibility of sending soldiers from Western countries was also denied in the USA, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, Great Britain, Germany, Lithuania and Canada. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also spoke out against it. In addition, the absence of such plans was stated by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Meanwhile, The Washington Post wrote that more than 20 thousand foreign mercenaries are currently taking part in the ranks of the Ukrainian army in the combat zone. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"30 November 2023","American President Joe Biden must persuade Ukraine to negotiate peace, since prolonging the conflict will have a negative impact on both Kyiv and Washington. This position was voiced by columnist Anatol Lieven in an article for the publication Responsible Statecraft on November 29. He emphasized that the situation at the front remains hopeless for Ukraine: the West can provide new weapons, but there are not enough soldiers in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). Mobilization is hampered by a large number of draft dodgers, while the Russian army is constantly strengthening its defensive lines and producing more weapons than the West can offer Kyiv. “Therefore, a ceasefire and negotiations for a peaceful settlement are becoming increasingly necessary for Ukraine. <...> Recognizing this, the Biden administration is reportedly privately advising the Ukrainian government to begin negotiations with Russia,” Lieven writes. However, in his opinion, such calls “behind closed doors” from the United States are not enough. While Washington publicly continues to insist that only Kyiv can dictate its own rules in the negotiations, the situation becomes more complicated. The author suggested that the United States will decide to distance itself from the decision-making and will prefer to hope that the problem will resolve itself. But such a prolongation of the conflict will most likely only make the consequences worse. “Ukraine may not be able to hold out that long, and a major Russian success […] will force the Biden administration to make a painful choice: accept Ukraine’s defeat, which would be a significant humiliation for the United States and NATO.” or threaten direct intervention and risk nuclear war with Russia,” Lieven concluded.

The Russian leader also emphasized that any military action is always a tragedy, and indicated that “we must think about how to stop this tragedy.” On November 9, the United States predicted early negotiations on Ukraine due to pressure on the country’s President Vladimir Zelensky. The Responsible Statecraft columnist said that, in his opinion, in addition to the pressure coming from within the domestic political and military circle of the Ukrainian leader, diplomatic pressure also comes from leading international partners, so Ukraine will be forced to negotiate.

The Iranian publication Akharin khabar wrote about this on April 13. “This stuff can be interpreted as an indirect indication to Kyiv that it is not ready not only for a counter-offensive, but in general for active hostilities with any positive result for itself,” it says in an article, the translation of which was published on InoSMI.

He said that the West independently decides what weapons and equipment it is ready to transfer to Kiev. On March 16, military expert Alexei Lenkov, in a conversation with Izvestia, expressed the opinion that it is not in vain that Kyiv is asking Washington for a Patriot. According to him, Ukrainian formations have already lost many long-range radar stations, and they have nothing to replace the equipment inherited from the Soviet Union. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to hold it was made by the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region as a result of shelling by Ukrainian forces.

"23 January 2024","The crisis at the US-Mexico border has taken center stage in Republican presidential debates in New Hampshire, where primaries are scheduled to take place on January 23. And this is against the backdrop of general unsettlement in the country and huge payments to Ukraine. It is becoming increasingly difficult for President Joe Biden to explain to Americans why they should give money from their wallets to a distant country, American political scientist Sergei Sudakov noted in a conversation with Izvestia. Border upset: US migration crisis deprives Ukraine of money Biden has to choose between supporting Kyiv and the votes of the Latin American electorate “A country that will never return this money and will not benefit ordinary Americans. If earlier they treated this with humor and said that this did not concern them, now they understand: for those dollars that are invested in Ukraine, they pay for lousy railways, daily train crashes, potholes on the asphalt and increased prices in stores and for gasoline,” he emphasized. While financial and military assistance from the European Union and the United States is delayed, Ukraine, as The Wall Street Journal writes, has only a few months of funds left; then Kyiv will have to survive due to non-payment of salaries, pensions and the abolition of subsidies for housing and communal services. Since last year, Congress has been unable to agree on a bill to provide military funding to Ukraine and Israel. The stumbling block between Republicans and Democrats remains the issue of border protection. “Biden’s dilemma is that he will now need to play along with the Republicans, put his chances in the elections on the line and thereby walk between Scylla and Charybdis. Everyone understands that as soon as he introduces such restrictions on migration, a huge number of voters will turn away from him,” Sudakov continued. The expert added that the essence of the compromise is also that Biden will have to report on the money sent and describe the concept of victory in Ukraine. In return, Republicans will support a permanent budget with funding for Kyiv, Sudakov believes.

"October 2023","US President Joe Biden on Wednesday, October 4, told reporters that he was concerned about the prospect of a possible refusal on the part of Congress to continue providing assistance to Ukraine. He was asked whether he was concerned about the turbulence occurring in the House of Representatives of Congress in light of the allocation of new funding for needs Kyiv. “Dysfunction is always a concern to me,” Biden said, adding that majorities of the House and Senate from both parties have said they support funding for Ukraine. He also said he would soon give a keynote speech on the importance of support for Ukraine as political turmoil in Congress threatens to derail aid to Kiev. “I will very soon announce an important speech I am going to give on this issue and why it is critical for the United States and our allies that we live up to our commitments,” Biden reported, whose words were quoted by Barron's. During his conversation with reporters, the American leader also refused to clarify whether he promised Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to supply ATACMS missiles. “I talked with Zelensky, and we worked out everything he asked for,” the US President answered evasively. Complete shutdown: in the United States there is a threat of a government shutdown By the end of the month, Congress must formulate a budget for the next fiscal year. Earlier on this day, American political scientist Malek Dudakov predicted a significant reduction in funding for Ukraine from Washington. He also did not rule out that Congress may completely refuse to allocate new funds to support Ukraine, since there are already serious problems with finding consensus on this issue. At the same time, Senator Alexei Pushkov said that the split in Congress on the issue of supporting Kyiv has moved from a “rhetorical plane to practical."" Thus, the senator spoke about the resignation of Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy - the first case in US history of removing the speaker of the lower house. The post of head of the US House of Representatives became vacant on October 3, after congressmen voted for the removal of Speaker Kevin McCarthy for the first time in US history. The reason for this was the resignation of his associate Mattel Gaetz, who on October 2 accused McCarthy of lying to Congress and US President Joe Biden in connection with the decision to finance the government. On the same day, the coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council (NSC) of the White House John Kirby said that the United States will have enough money to provide assistance to Ukraine for about a couple of months if Congress does not allocate new ones. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 Russian leader Vladimir Putin after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"December 13 2023","“Really new moments” have appeared in international rhetoric on the Ukrainian issue, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov noted on December 13 to Izvestia. He pointed out that even in Washington they started talking about supporting Kyiv only within the framework of the possible. “First of all, Washington, and it is echoed by European states, still actively repeat the mantra that they will always support Ukraine as long as necessary. But now reservations are already appearing in the sense that they will do this within the limits of the possible. And indeed, first of all, Americans began to wonder, what exactly are they spending that kind of money on?” - he said. Peskov recalled that the Kiev regime promised the Americans “victory on the battlefield” for $100 billion, and now they understand that they were deceived - there is no victory on the battlefield. Moreover, the Ukrainian armed forces are rapidly and inevitably losing ground. “Well, completely incomparable military potential, incomparable economic power, and so on. Therefore, the situation here is obvious. Americans in this situation, of course, are wondering, do we need to prepare the next tens of billions of dollars?” - he continued. The Kremlin representative pointed out how the White House proudly announced the signing of a decree for $200 million in military assistance to Ukraine - a very modest amount by US standards. This puts the Kiev regime, according to Peskov, in a rather difficult position, but Russia will “watch this with interest and, most importantly, continue the special military operation,” he added. The promise has been delayed for two years: Ukraine is losing US support. What Zelensky and Biden talked about in Washington. On December 12, the second day of the Ukrainian leader’s visit to the United States ended. Experts noted: Zelensky tried to prove with his trip that he “did everything possible to provide military assistance.” On December 11, he met with representatives of defense companies in Washington and asked for their advice before negotiations with US President Joe Biden. The next day, he visited the White House, held negotiations with its owner and received a new package of military assistance to Ukraine worth $200 million. During a press conference following a meeting with the Ukrainian leader, Joe Biden said that Washington was rapidly approaching the loss of its ability to provide further assistance to Kiev. On the same day, American Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a statement to the press, explained that the new package of assistance to Ukraine from the United States would include ammunition for air defense systems (air defense), HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems, as well as artillery. In addition, , Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova mentioned Blinken’s statement that about 90% of financial military assistance to Kyiv remained in the United States. She emphasized that the American diplomat’s statement is not only misleading, but also confirms that for Washington “Ukraine is an opportunity to line its pockets.” Share: if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1620154'); } else { document.addEventListener('recommendationRunInit', function() { if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1620154'); } }); }",2023-12-13
"15 September 2023","Public organizations in Germany are going to hold anti-Russian protests in front of the Berlin State Opera. This was reported by Der Tagesspiegel on September 14. They are connected with the performance of opera singer Anna Netrebko scheduled for September 15. Read more in the Izvestia article. Protests in Berlin over Netrebko’s performance - what happened On Friday, September 15, the premiere of the opera “Macbeth” by Giuseppe Verdi will take place on the stage of the Berlin theater, in which Netrebko will play the main female role. This is the first of four planned performances by the Russian artist at the Berlin State Opera. According to the publication, this event caused discontent among various public organizations. They sent an open letter to the Berlin leadership and opera director Matthias Schulz demanding that Netrebko's performances be cancelled. A petition was also created against her, which was signed by about 36 thousand people. However, the opera's management did not listen to the activists' objections, after which protests were announced. Netrebko is accused of supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin and lacking a clear position on the special operation in Donbass. Activists believe that while abroad, the singer “did not sufficiently distance herself” from her performances in Russia. Cultural unrest: Netrebko will sing in Zurich, but the Bolshoi will not come to London How geopolitical tensions affect the work of artists The mayor of Berlin, Kai Wegner, spoke out against Netrebko’s participation in productions of the Berlin State Opera. According to him, he is “very critical” of her performances. Senator for Culture Joe Cialo, in turn, said that he would not come to any of the planned performances. The Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany, Alexey Makeev, also criticized the opera management for collaborating with Netrebko. In his opinion, the directorate of a cultural organization is sending a “sign of normalcy” by justifying the performance of a Russian artist in Berlin. “I’m sorry that the opera prefers to hear Ms. Netrebko’s soprano instead of our arguments,” Der Tagesspiegel quoted him as saying. The diplomat said that on the day of the performance he, along with Senator Chialo, intends to visit an anti-Russian photo exhibition located opposite the Berlin State Opera. Protests in Berlin due to Netrebko’s speech - where it all began Netrebko resumed performances in European theaters in May 2022 after a break, which she took against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass. After the outbreak of hostilities, the New York Metropolitan Opera and the Bavarian State Opera broke their contracts with her, since the singer did not refuse public support for Putin. Netrebko's first European concert took place in Italy on the stage of the La Scala theater. Subsequently, she performed in other countries. At the same time, in August 2022, a protest was organized against her concert in Cologne with the participation of 50 people. The artist’s opponents urged her not to applaud her, but the public still greeted Netrebko with applause. “How can we be “cancelled”? This is some kind of stupidity!” Producer and composer Igor Matvienko talks about the disruption of the Lube tour in Germany, a new competition for songwriters and the difficult path of SHAMAN In March 2023, the singer managed through the court to receive compensation from the Metropolitan Opera in the amount of $200 thousand for canceled concerts. At the same time, the judge ordered her to pay about $30 thousand in fines for “extremely inappropriate” statements after the start of the special operation. In early August 2023, Netrebko again sued the New York theater, demanding compensation in the amount of $360 thousand. She indicated that the management of the Metropolitan -opera violated the agreement and discriminated against it on the basis of nationality by canceling concerts for 2024–2025. In addition, the lawsuit states that the statements of theater director Peter Gelb had a bad impact on the audience's attitude towards the artist, and also caused protests.

"13 April 2023","An air raid alert has been declared throughout Ukraine. This is evidenced by the data of the interactive map of air alerts of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of the country on Thursday, April 13. Based on these data, alarms sounded in all regions almost simultaneously at 11:28. An alarm was also declared in the territories of Kherson and Zaporozhye regions and Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). Castles in the air: Russian air defense destroyed 60% of targets in the special operation zone And on the ground - in the Bryansk region - a group of Ukrainian saboteurs was eliminated. Earlier, on April 4, it was reported that an air raid warning had been announced in the Odessa region. Two days before this, alarms sounded in four regions of Ukraine, namely in Dnepropetrovsk, Poltava, Sumy and Kharkov. There was no official information from the Russian Ministry of Defense about attacks on these territories. Russian troops began striking critical targets in Ukraine on October 10 2022. As Russian President Vladimir Putin explained then, this was a response to the terrorist actions of the Kyiv regime, in particular on the Crimean Bridge. Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov noted in turn that all the targets hit were related to the military potential of Ukraine. A special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues.

"14 July 2023","Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov, in a conversation with Izvestia, commented on the words of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Russian leader Vladimir Putin allegedly agreed to extend the grain deal. “We have not made any statements in this regard,” Peskov said. Earlier this year day, Reuters published a statement by Erdogan, in which he expressed hope for an extension of the grain deal. At the same time, the head of state indicated that he and the Russian leader had the same opinion on the issue of the further operation of the initiative. Question: what is known about the future of the grain deal? Russia does not see prospects for extending the grain deal, but continues consultations. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres personally sent a letter to Putin on July 13, which contains “concrete proposals” and is aimed at a “positive way out” of the situation. Back on July 12, Guterres suggested that the Russian leader maintain the grain deal for a few more months - until the European Union solves the problems with connecting Rosselkhozbank (RSHB) to the SWIFT system. At the same time, Putin himself said that he had not seen Guterres’ letter about the grain deal, but Russia is in contact with UN employees who are trying to ensure that Western countries fulfill their obligations, but so far nothing has worked out for them. At the same time, the president emphasized that Russia’s interests in the dialogue on extending the grain deal are being ignored. The food deal was concluded on July 22, 2022 in Istanbul. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Antonio Guterres signed a memorandum on facilitating the supply of Russian agricultural products and fertilizers to world markets. At the same time, the Ukrainian delegation signed an agreement with Turkey and the UN on grain exports.

The company reported this to Defense News on October 26. “They [drones] are actually used by the Ukrainians, and have been for some time. We have some channels of communication with the troops who use drones in order to receive feedback and make appropriate improvements,” company representative Jernej Moderc shared at a conference in Brno. The number of drones transferred to Ukraine was not specified, but Moderc said that there were several of them. There is also no mention of the delivery period. It is also unknown whether the company supplied the drones independently or whether they were transferred to the Slovenian Ministry of Defense. The department did not comment on the information.

He noted that offensive operations in different sectors of the front have been ongoing for several days. Earlier, on May 23, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Kirill Budanov, noted that the country has the necessary minimum to launch an offensive, but this is not enough for success. In mid-May, the Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky admitted that if the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is unsuccessful, less active countries may reduce assistance to Kyiv. Zelensky also added that Ukraine has neither the intention nor the sufficient quantity of weapons to launch strikes on Russian territory. The upcoming counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces became known in the spring of this year.

These are “Right Sector”, “Azov”, “Aidar” (extremist and terrorist organizations banned in Russia). They were recruiting young people in different nationalist groups,” TASS quoted him as saying. Ganjala noted that recruiting young people is not the norm.

This opinion was expressed by experts to the Chinese publication Global Times. According to them, by declaring May 9 as Europe Day, Zelensky is seeking to strengthen relations between Ukraine, the United States and NATO. Kyiv hopes for their support and possible intervention in the fight against Russia. “However, Zelensky can do little with the United States - the instigator of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is now working for Europe,” said military expert Song Zhongping. The publication notes that Ukraine is trying to move away from Russia in matters of history and values. However, the United States, NATO and the European Union (EU) have their own plans that make it difficult to fully support Kyiv. Analysts also noted that the EU’s intention to introduce the 11th package of sanctions against Russia will not be as effective, since the previous ten had a limited impact on the economy RF.

In addition, Zelensky proposed celebrating May 8 as the Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in World War II. Then State Duma deputy from the Crimean region Mikhail Sheremet called this decision a betrayal of the Ukrainian people. He expressed hope that the people of the country will rise up, remember their faith and centuries-old history and “throw off the current corrupt, fascist regime.” As the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the decree of the Ukrainian leader, there are many people in Ukraine for whom May 9 is a sacred day . For veterans who took part in the Great Patriotic War, as well as for their relatives and friends, this day will and will remain sacred. The Ukrainian authorities continue their course towards breaking ties with Russia and abandoning a common history.

According to party representatives, the Yoon Seok Yeol administration “behaves in an extremely shameful manner, blindly and unilaterally supporting the US position.” “Leopard” and other animals: what weapons has Ukraine already received? Kyiv is preparing a big offensive, experts made predictions. Earlier that day, South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol, in an interview with Reuters, said that the country could expand support for Ukraine and go beyond humanitarian and economic assistance . Thus, for the first time, he indicated a change in position on military support for Kiev. According to the South Korean leader, his government is studying how to help protect and restore Ukraine. He compared the situation to how South Korea received international assistance during the Korean War of 1950-1953. Earlier, on April 12, it became known that the administration of US President Joe Biden signed a contract with South Korea to receive half a million 155-mm shells on credit. The South Korean authorities believe that with this form of agreement, ownership of the shells remains with Seoul and the ammunition will need to be returned later. Moscow began a special operation to protect Donbass on February 24, 2022. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region as a result of shelling by the Ukrainian military.

He commented on the British authorities’ statement about the transfer of this type of missile in an export modification to the Ukrainian side. “This statement is aimed at escalating the confrontation and instilling a false impression in Ukraine “that they (missiles - Ed.) can reach a range of 250 km, and, accordingly, that it can achieve victory and positive results in its counter-offensive, which is promoted through the media,” he said.

"December 18 2023","One of the reasons why the deputy of the Keretskovsky village council of the Transcarpathian region of Ukraine Sergei Batrin exploded several grenades during a meeting was the conflict between the head of the community and a certain military man over bonuses. This version was published on December 18 by the Ukrainian publication Strana.ua. In the footage it published, taken on the eve of the explosion, you can see an argument between the chairman and a certain man in military uniform. The latter at some point spoke out against bonuses to the head of the assembly, proposing to use these funds for purchases for military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). “The job of the head of the community for bonuses is to go resolve issues, and be kind enough to buy us quadcopters. This is work for a bonus,” says the man. During the discussion, Batrin supports him. The incident occurred on December 15. In Ukraine, in the village of Keretski, in the building of the village council, a deputy exploded three grenades during a meeting. 23 people were injured, including the suspect himself, and one person died. Most of the victims were diagnosed with shrapnel wounds. On the evening of December 16, Batrin regained consciousness in the hospital, and a day later, on December 17, he was arrested. The police regarded the incident as a terrorist attack. Ukrainian media previously wrote that Batrin could have blown up the grenades due to a quarrel with colleagues. The motive could have been a conflict between the people's deputy, which occurred a few minutes before the incident. He told his colleagues that during hostilities it was impossible to give the village head a 50% increase and a monthly bonus of 100% of the salary. However, the claims and arguments had no effect, then he went out and returned with grenades. In turn, the country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs stated that Batrin had prepared for the crime in advance. They also added that starting next year, all Ukrainian schools will have officers who will monitor order and security.

"28 February 2024","Ethnic Hungarians living in the Transcarpathian region of Ukraine should get back their rights, which they enjoyed before 2015 on Ukrainian territory. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Economic Relations of Hungary, Peter Szijjártó, announced this on February 28. “Until 2015, they (Hungarians - Ed.) enjoyed all the necessary rights. Unfortunately, since then their rights began to be gradually violated and reduced <...> Hungary believes that Hungarians living in Ukraine should get back all their rights that they enjoyed before 2015,” he said, speaking at a session of the UN Council for Human Rights in Geneva, broadcast on the organization’s website. According to Szijjártó, 150 thousand ethnic Hungarians live in Ukraine. At the same time, from September 2023, 99 schools of the Hungarian minority were turned into Ukrainian schools with limited teaching of the national language of Hungary. Szijjártó emphasized that Budapest demands from Kyiv only the return of the rights to the Hungarians that they already had.

Earlier, on February 26, the TSN television channel reported that Ukrainian citizens of Hungarian origin living in the Transcarpathian region began to receive threatening messages. It is assumed that the messages are being sent by Ukrainian nationalists with the aim of provoking interethnic strife. Prior to this, on January 28, the Hungarian politician, head of the Our Motherland party Laszlo Torockai said that if Ukraine loses statehood, then Transcarpathia as an autonomy could reunite with Hungary peacefully. At the same time, Torotskai noted that at that time only the Our Motherland party had expressed claims to Transcarpathia; the other parliamentary parties did not make such claims. In November 2023, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that the situation with the Hungarian language in Transcarpathia under the USSR was better than under Ukraine. According to Orban, Ukraine “continues to punish Transcarpathians,” so Hungary will provide them with the necessary assistance. Transcarpathia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the First World War and the collapse of the Habsburg Empire, the region became part of Czechoslovakia, within which it existed until 1939, when it was annexed by Hungary. After the end of World War II, an agreement was signed in Moscow on the entry of Transcarpathia into the Ukrainian SSR.

This was stated on Thursday, June 8, by the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko at a meeting with the secretaries of the Security Councils of the CSTO countries. “You can probably guess who blew up the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric station. They say that a thief's hat is on fire. Who was the first to shout about it? It is clear that the Ukrainian side had to hide three days of counterattack. Therefore - Kakhovka, Kakhovka, but no one talks about losses. And this is all visible,” he said.

He emphasized that American tanks are driving through Russian territory. “It’s bad, but they drive until a certain point, and then they burn.

"April 20 2023","The US authorities do not tell their citizens that it is impossible to resist Russian troops in the Ukrainian conflict. This point of view was expressed on April 20 by the nephew of the 35th US President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy Jr., who announced his candidacy for the post of head of the White House in a conversation with Fox News. “The Russians are fighting in a ratio of seven to one to eight to one, we we cannot resist them,” he noted. According to Kennedy Jr., the Ukrainian conflict has become a huge geopolitical problem for Washington, as it causes a rapprochement between Russia and China, which, in turn, represents the worst outcome for the United States. In conclusion the politician wondered what the United States had forgotten in Ukraine. “Leopard” and other animals: what weapons Ukraine has already received Kyiv is preparing a big offensive, experts made predictions Earlier, on April 19, Bloomberg indicated that the longer the Ukrainian conflict continues, the more unpleasant its consequences will become for US President Joe Biden. who decided to help Kyiv and at the same time resist China. According to the author of the article, over time it will become more difficult to finance military assistance to Ukraine, since the situation in eastern Europe distracts the White House from the real danger posed by China. Prior to this, on April 12, the US presidential administration signed a contract with South Korea to receive half a million 155- millimeter shells on credit. It is noted that this is five times the amount of ammunition that South Korea transferred to the United States in 2022. After this, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene called the American administration failures. The fact that Washington gave Kyiv so much ammunition that it was “forced to borrow” 500 thousand artillery shells from Seoul is inexcusable.

However, he considered that the Ukrainian conflict had opened up new prospects for the defense industry of Slovakia. “Today, ammunition for Ukraine is bought through (the system - Ed.) of centralized European procurement and if we do not produce them in Slovakia, providing the country with income and jobs, then they will will be produced in a neighboring country and they will still end up where they should end up,” said the Slovak politician. “Slovakia is taking an active part in arming Ukraine” Russian Ambassador in Bratislava Igor Bratchikov - about supplies to Kyiv, the consequences of sanctions and gratitude for preserving historical memory Earlier, on June 9, it was reported that most of the weapons from the new US military aid package to Ukraine in the amount of $2 .1 billion will not be sent to Ukraine in the near future.

They will try to do something creative in the spirit of “Minsk-3,” Kuleba said. The Foreign Minister stressed that if the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) does not lead to the complete liberation of the country’s territory, then some people in the West may say that this was the last attempt at a decisive battle, and now we need to think about an alternative scenario. Kuleba believes that for Kyiv there is no alternative to the complete restoration of territorial integrity.

He noted in the article that Russian forces are constantly growing, as the military industry of the Russian Federation is working at full speed. “The Russian arms industry, put on a military footing, supplies a lot of new, as well as repaired and modernized equipment from post-Soviet resources,” the article states. The observer also adds that the mobilized Russian reservists underwent good military training. Ukraine, he adds, against the backdrop of huge losses, has almost exhausted its mobilization resources. In such a situation, the country's financial capabilities, military industry and its demographics do not play into the army's hands. The coveted dose: the United States decided not to rush to help Ukraine Zelensky personally flew to Washington for weapons and money, but there is almost no chance of getting them. Earlier, on December 8, Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a conversation with military personnel after the ceremony of awarding gold stars to the Heroes of Russia, said that The defense industry of the Russian Federation is gaining momentum. He noted that people work “more and more competently” and factories began to produce many times more. Prior to this, on October 17, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu noted that the federal executive authorities of Russia had taken measures to increase the production of artillery systems. He pointed out that the Russian government has granted the defense industry the right to use all reserves, including mobilization capacities. In the same month, ex-Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov noted that mobilization in Ukraine has turned into a nightmare for Ukrainians; this resource in the country has been depleted. Azarov recalled that Ukrainians are fleeing the country using all means. On December 7, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are forced to switch to strategic defense in attempts to resist the advance of Russian troops. In addition, the material clarifies that the failures of the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian army force Western countries to question the provision of new assistance to Kyiv.

The clergyman wrote about this on Facebook on March 26 (belongs to Meta, banned in the Russian Federation). Metropolitan Luke explained that his decision reflects not so much the position of the hierarch and the monk, but of a simple believer. According to the hierarch, when he sees what is happening to the Orthodox shrine in the capital of Ukraine, he feels like “his heart is bleeding.” The hierarch added that he will be on a hunger strike in the St. Nicholas Monastery in Zaporozhye. At the same time, the Metropolitan called on believers to visit this monastery and support the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) with their prayer. He also addressed the believers with a request to strengthen their fast for the next few days, because just before March 29, at the request of the Kyiv regime, the monks of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra must leave the monastery. Earlier on that day, the Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), Metropolitan of Kiev and All Ukraine Onuphry held his last service in the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Thousands of UOC believers came to prayer. After reading the Gospel, Primate Onuphry addressed them with a sermon. It is difficult to be with God: monks are expelled from the main monastery of Ukraine. In the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra they are talking about the beginning of the apocalypse. Earlier, on March 23, the UOC appealed to believers with a call to defend the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra by all legal means. On this day, the monastery was cordoned off by the Ukrainian police. On March 21, the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine announced the closure of part of the territory of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra due to identified violations. At the same time, the leadership and all clergy are obliged to leave the monastery before March 29. Otherwise, as the country's Minister of Culture Alexander Tkachenko said, security forces will be sent to the Lavra to resolve the situation. In 2022, the Ukrainian authorities intensified actions directed against the UOC. They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” Thus, in December 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) opened 50 criminal cases against priests of the UOC.

"March 2024","The topic related to the leak of a conversation between representatives of the German army about attacks on the Crimean Bridge overlaps with the militaristic rhetoric of Germany. Russian Ambassador to Berlin Sergei Nechaev stated this on Wednesday, March 6. “Moreover, this topic overlaps with the extremely aggressive militaristic rhetoric heard in Germany at a high political level. I mean the public calls of some politicians to prepare the Bundeswehr and German society for war with Russia, to transfer military operations to the territory of our country, to strike Russian ministries and infrastructure,” he shared with TASS. Nechaev noted that the situation around the leak of content conversation speaks of Germany's involvement in the Ukrainian conflict. The diplomat emphasized that not all of the German leadership shares this approach, as they are aware of the consequences of such actions. “Nevertheless, it must be clearly understood that any planning related to the possibility of striking Russian civilian infrastructure, including the Crimean Bridge, is “, in fact, participation in the preparation of a terrorist act,” the ambassador noted. He added that the Kiev regime has shown many times that any Western weapon can be turned against Russian civilians. Swan, cancer and Scholz: Germany publicly quarreled with its allies Berlin helped Kyiv with everyone, but now it is accused of indifference On March 1, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published a full transcript of the discussion of senior German army officials about Taurus missile strikes on the Crimean Bridge, which, according to her data , took place on February 19. During the conversation, the military discussed the supply of Taurus missiles to Ukraine. In a fragment of an audio recording from representatives of the German Air Force, officers discussed how many such shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether such a strike would be effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr Inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the authorities are promptly investigating the situation around publication of a recording of a conversation between German officers in Ukraine. He indicated that what happened was a “very serious problem.” Later, Bild reported that Graefe was to blame for the leak of the conversation, since during the conversation he was in Singapore and connected through an unsecured network. Also, in connection with what happened, the German Ambassador to Russia Alexander Lambsdorff was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry on March 4. The German diplomat stayed in the ministry building for more than an hour and then left it without answering journalists’ questions. The Ukrainian side is making attempts to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, as this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"February 2024","The US Senate has introduced a bill worth $118 billion, providing assistance to Ukraine and Israel, as well as protecting the southern American border. The corresponding document was published on February 4 on the website of the Senate Appropriations Committee. According to the text of the document, $60 billion is planned to be allocated to the Kyiv regime, $14.1 billion to Israel, $20.2 billion to strengthen the border with Mexico due to the serious problem with the high number of illegal migrants. It is also reported that $2.4 billion may be allocated to continue the operation against the Shiite movement Ansar Allah (Houthis) in Yemen. As specified, as part of the next American assistance to the Kyiv regime, $14 billion may be transferred for the purchase of new weapons from military-industrial companies complex of the United States, as well as $15 billion for military training of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). In turn, US President Joe Biden expressed support for the Senate bill and called on Congress to pass it as soon as possible. The coveted dose: the United States decided not to rush to help Ukraine Zelensky personally flew to Washington for weapons and money, but there is almost no chance of getting them. Earlier on the same day, Deputy Chairman of the Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence of the Verkhovna Rada Yegor Chernev said that the situation at the front is becoming critical for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On February 2, Polish expert of the Jagiellonian Club Marcin Kędzierski, in an interview with Polskie Radio 24, emphasized that Ukraine would not be able to survive the conflict without the help of Western countries against the backdrop of the collapse of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). He noted that even the long-term aid package of €50 billion allocated by the European Union to Kyiv will not help save the situation. On February 1, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) predicted a significant reduction in international financial assistance in 2025–2026. The regulator's report states that the rhythm of external receipts has been lost, and uncertainty regarding the approval of new assistance has increased. According to White House Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby, the European funding package cannot replace American assistance, since it is not intended for military support. At the same time, on January 31, he noted that Washington has no alternative option for continuing military supplies to Kyiv without Congressional approval of US President Joe Biden’s request for $106 billion. On January 16, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States does not have a “magic pot” of which could be financed by Ukraine without approval of requests in Congress. He recognized as a “real problem” a situation in which Congress would not approve the allocation of funds to Kiev. On the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ended in absolute failure; the initiative in the special operation zone lies entirely with Russian military personnel. According to him, if this continues, the question of Ukraine’s statehood will arise. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"16 February 2024","The Kiel Institute of World Economics in Germany published a study on Friday, February 16, the data of which indicate a large difference between the military aid promised and allocated to Ukraine. Thus, according to the material, Washington’s assistance to Kyiv ceased by the end of 2023, while the European Union ( The EU) as of 15 January 2024 had pledged aid totaling €144 billion, but had committed only €77 billion for specific purposes. The amount of total financial assistance allocated by the EU (€34 billion) is similar to the total amount of military assistance (€35.2 billion). Some major donors, such as the Scandinavian countries, as well as Germany and the UK, continue to provide support, while many other states have promised or provided few funds or stopped supplies altogether, the report says. As noted in the study, Germany is the largest European sponsor of military aid. Since February 2022, Germany has committed to provide €17.7 billion, of which only €9.4 billion has actually been realized through specific deliveries. By contrast, France has pledged just €0.64 billion in military aid from 2022, while the UK has pledged €4.8 billion of a pledged €9.1 billion. “Europe will have to at least double its current military support efforts in in the absence of further support from the United States. EU countries are among the richest in the world, and so far they have not spent even 1% of their GDP (gross domestic product - Ed.) in 2021 to support Ukraine,” said study author and researcher at the institute Christophe Trebesch. Supplies are at a standstill: what critical weapons could Kyiv be left without? The reduction in Western aid not only deprives Ukraine of the ability to attack, but also reduces its defense capabilities. On February 13, the US Senate approved aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan in the amount of $95 billion. At the same time, The Guardian notes , that the project has little chance of passing the House of Representatives, since US House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized it for the lack of provisions put forward by Republicans to stop the record flow of migrants on the border with Mexico. Later, on February 16, it was reported that the US House of Representatives did not voted on a bill to help Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and went on a break until the end of February. On February 14, the head of the US Treasury, Janet Yellen, indicated that budgetary support for Ukraine from the United States is more important to the Kyiv regime than ever before. In her opinion, the allocation of additional funds to Kyiv will be an “assurance” to all other donors that Washington will continue to support along with other Western countries. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on 24 February 2022. The decision to hold it was made by Russian President Vladimir Putin against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to the aggression of Ukrainian troops. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce aid to Kyiv.

"21 November 2023","Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said on November 20 that he had filled out a questionnaire for a national consultation on controversial topics between Budapest and Brussels, calling on the country's citizens to also take part in it, in order to “not dance to the tune” of the European Commission. “Brussels bureaucrats want to again tell us how to live. They want to give more money and new weapons to Ukraine. <…> But we are Hungarians, and we do not want to dance to the tune of Brussels. Therefore, I ask you to express your opinion and fill out the national consultation questionnaire,” Orban said in a video message that he published on the social network Facebook (owned by Meta, a recognized extremist organization and banned in the Russian Federation). The Prime Minister posted a photo with a completed questionnaire, in which it is clear that he supported the preservation of preferential utility bills, the extension of the frozen interest rate until 2024, the preservation of the excess profit tax for large companies and opposed the placement of migrants in the country in accordance with the new EU rules. It is noted that posters with images of the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and the son of American billionaire George Soros, Alex, calling on the Hungarians “not to dance to their tune.” Expendable business: Hungary opposed new funding for Ukraine and called for the start of peace negotiations Earlier, on November 17, it was reported that national consultations would begin, during which citizens of the country would express their opinions on disagreements with the European Union, as well as Ukraine’s entry into the bloc and the provision of military assistance. The fact that Orban proposed holding national consultations in the country on issues of Ukraine, migration and the economy in order to enlist the support of citizens became known on October 27. He noted that about 11 questions have accumulated that concern all citizens of the country, so people need to be given the opportunity to speak out.

"May 2023","The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) cannot respond to daily powerful Russian missile attacks at the front. Oleg Soskin, a former adviser to ex-President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma, stated this on May 3. “The Russians beat, beat, beat all the time. Thirty, forty, fifty, sixty <...> attacks, but Ukraine doesn’t attack and can’t do anything,” he said in his YouTube channel. Soskin noted that the timing of the offensive planned by the Armed Forces of Ukraine is constantly shifting. The expert emphasized that this disappoints Ukrainians and the West, and also weakens faith in the success of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. “We can repel any attack” While it rains in the Donbass, Russian and Ukrainian troops are preparing for new battles Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said that the West will supply Kyiv with combat aircraft when Ukrainian troops go on the offensive. He did not name the timing of a possible counterattack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. A day earlier, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said that the decision on the supply of F-16 fighters to Kyiv would depend on the results of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. He also noted that if the Ukrainian Armed Forces already had F-16s, the counteroffensive “would be faster.” Information about the Kyiv regime preparing a counteroffensive appeared several months ago. At the end of April, Soskin emphasized that Zelensky was not coping with his responsibilities, the promised counter-offensive was not ready. Earlier, on April 27, the assistant to the head of Chechnya, the commander of the Akhmat special forces, Apty Alaudinov, called the defeat of Kyiv inevitable in the event of a counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

"22 January 2024","The new decree of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky “On the territories of the Russian Federation historically inhabited by Ukrainians” is a simple propaganda move caused by the failure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at the front. This was stated by Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev on January 22. “<...> he (Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky - Ed.) signed a decree on territorial claims to Russia on lands “historically inhabited by Ukrainians.” There is nothing to comment on here, since Ukrainians are Russians, and Little Russia is part of Russia. And it’s time for the main “Ukrainian” to quit. So he will soon annex Canada,” Medvedev wrote in his Telegram channel. I give you a trident: how much do they ask for a Ukrainian passport on the black market? Why do residents of the CIS countries pretend to be “hulks”? Earlier on the same day, Zelensky signed a decree “On the territories of the Russian Federation historically inhabited by Ukrainians.” The document was published on the website of his office. The President instructed the Government of Ukraine to develop, together with international experts, representatives of the World Congress of Ukrainians, scientists and the public, an action plan to preserve the national identity of Ukrainians in Russia. At the same time, it became known that Zelensky would propose to the Rada a bill on multiple citizenship, which would make it possible to grant Ukrainian citizenship to ethnic Ukrainians, with the exception of Russian citizens, and foreign mercenaries. A similar right will be granted to foreign mercenaries who serve on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader stated this in a video message. On January 8, the former commander-in-chief of the US Army in Europe, retired General Ben Hodges, said that Ukraine will lose territories during the conflict with Russia due to the inability to resist the army due to a catastrophic shortage of ammunition. According to the Ukrainian military, some units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) have already had to reduce their rate of fire by 90% compared to the summer.

"January 2024","Britain and other countries intend to support Ukraine even if the US withdraws if former US President Donald Trump wins the 2024 election, The Times wrote on December 31, citing a government source. “According to a senior Whitehall source , Great Britain and other European countries “launched the mechanism” to guarantee assistance to Ukraine <in the conflict> against Russia without the participation of the United States if Donald Trump comes to power,” the newspaper writes. To this end, British ministers are trying to increase production capacity across the continent to send weapons and ammunition to the front line for at least another year, regardless of US support, prolong the conflict with the Russian Federation. According to military intelligence leaders, Ukraine will not be able to defeat Russia in 2024, since it has neither manpower nor weapons for a large breakthrough on the battlefield. However, it is possible to try to prolong the debilitating confrontation between the two countries until 2025, they are sure. At the same time, there are fears in British government circles that it may be necessary to fill the hole in financing the Kyiv regime and the production of weapons for Ukraine if Trump is re-elected and there is US support in this matter lost. The promised two years are being squeezed: Ukraine is losing US support. What Zelensky and Biden talked about in Washington. On December 31, the head of the British government, Rishi Sunak, said in his New Year’s message that 2023 was a significant year for the country, but not at all in terms of the volume of support for Ukraine with money and weapons. Sunak did not mention unshakable solidarity with Kiev even once, concentrating on domestic politics and the achievements of the country’s economy. Prior to this, on December 15, the German Die Welt, citing an adviser to the office of the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, reported that Kyiv was concerned about the inaction of Great Britain in the matter of allocating a new military help. Britain has yet to present an official military aid budget for 2024, leaving Ukraine's armed forces unable to plan for the long term. On December 11, European leaders called on British Prime Minister Sunak to behave like Winston Churchill to ""restore the country's leadership role"" in Western support Ukraine. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022. The decision was made after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"21 March 2023","The Ukrainian conflict will last a long time, ex-President of Poland Alexander Kwasniewski expressed his opinion in an interview with RMF FM on Tuesday, March 21. “Unfortunately, I am convinced that <the special operation to protect Donbass> may drag on. Hopes that it will end this year are quite limited,” he said. It is important to be prepared for “limited security” - including for Warsaw, since “while Ukraine is at war, the threat to Poland is shifting several hundred kilometers to the east,” says Kwasniewski. They said it all: Western leaders spoke openly about the conflict in Ukraine What the recent statements of European politicians actually were. Many politicians predict a protracted nature of the conflict around Ukraine. Thus, the Prime Minister of the German federal state of Saxony, Michael Kretschmer, said on March 19 that the special operation to protect Donbass (SVO) will not end soon. The same opinion was expressed earlier, on March 8, by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during a meeting with fellow citizens in Cottbus (Brandenburg) . Separately, he pointed out the need to put the production of weapons and ammunition on a permanent basis. The last face-to-face round of negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine took place on March 29, 2022 in Turkey. Later, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow. On October 4, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky put into effect the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of the country on the impossibility of holding negotiations. The NDC for the defense of Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian leader Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues. The decision was made due to the aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"March 2023","Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh pointed out the gap between what any US president says about the war and the reality of the situation, citing the example of current head of state Joe Biden, who is trying to win public support for a position on Ukraine. This is stated in the journalist’s article published on his Substack page. Warsaw style: what Biden promised during his speech in Poland And how the American president's tour is connected to the US elections “There is an inevitable gap between what the president tells us about war, even proxy war, and reality,” the journalist noted. Hersh emphasized that this statement is true both for Biden, who is fighting for public support for his position on Ukraine, and for ex-President John Kennedy, under whom the Vietnam War was fought. He explained that Kennedy and his advisers did not realize that their opinions on the country and its inhabitants did not correspond to reality. Therefore, according to the journalist, the programs planned for Vietnam were doomed to failure. On February 8, Hersh published his investigation of sabotage on the Russian gas pipelines Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2. It says that American divers planted bombs during the Baltops exercise in the Baltic Sea back in June last year, and the Norwegians activated them. Washington’s motives, according to the journalist, were to force Germany to provide military and financial support to Ukraine. The United States and Norway deny their involvement. Later, on February 23, Hersh said that Biden decided to undermine Nord Stream solely for political reasons. In his opinion, the goal was to prevent Germany and Western Europe from opening the pipeline in case of imminent cold weather. German authorities imposed sanctions, stopped one pipeline, but had the right to open a new one, which Biden did not want, Hersh pointed out. New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin said on February 25 that Biden's promises to provide military support to Kyiv are meaningless because the US leader does not understand the real state of affairs in Ukraine. Earlier, on February 21, former US President Donald Trump said that Biden, by continuing to support Ukraine, was pushing humanity towards a third world war. He accused the US President of systematically escalating the confrontation between Washington and Moscow, and also suggested that the current leader of the country had gone mad. On February 1, Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matvienko noted that Kyiv would have sat down at the negotiating table if the US wanted it. According to her, the United States is not interested in ending the conflict, but in its escalation, and increasing arms supplies to Kyiv is not a call for peace.

The target of the strike was achieved, all designated targets were hit, the department noted. Reserves without strength: what was the purpose of the strikes on targets in Ukraine? Russian troops are undermining the ability of the Air Force to conduct active combat operations next year, experts believe.

"18 November 2023","Deputies of the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada are complaining about a shortage of ammunition amid the US decision to redirect shells reserved for Ukraine to Israel. Defense One reported this on November 17. “The situation is quite complicated. The intensity of heavy shelling on our part is decreasing due to a lack of ammunition,” said Ukrainian parliamentarian Yegor Cherniev, whose words are quoted in the article. Deputy Alexandra Ustinova, in turn, noted that she used to often visit the front, but is now afraid to come there because , in her words, “people literally have nothing to shoot with.” It is noted that the reduction in supplies from the United States coincides with a particularly difficult moment for Ukraine, as Russia steps up its offensive near Avdiivka, where intense fighting resembles that seen in Artemovsk (Ukrainian name is Bakhmut) last winter. The authors of the material add that the war in the Gaza Strip is not the only thing that slows down the supply of weapons from the United States to Ukraine. The funding pool approved by Congress to help Kyiv is practically empty, the article reports. Well, help: American aid to Ukraine will be revised. The form of support and its content will change, and the amounts will become smaller. On November 16, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, during a conversation with reporters, said that due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) began to experience a shortage 155mm artillery shells. The Ukrainian leader also noted that the ammunition currently supplied by Western countries cannot meet the needs of the Ukrainian army. Prior to this, on November 14, the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Dmitry Kuleba said that the European Union (EU) would not be able to supply the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the promised 1 million shells until the spring. Kuleba added that the main reason for the failure to fulfill the EU’s promise was bureaucracy and a large number of “out of sync things.” A day earlier, National Security Adviser to the American President Jake Sullivan said that financing the provision of necessary things to Ukraine is becoming more difficult every week due to the refusal of the House of Representatives of Congress to allocate additional funds for these purposes. On November 12, The Wall Street Journal also reported that Ukrainian Armed Forces military personnel were complaining about a significant shortage of ammunition and manpower. In connection with Russia's buildup of combat power and the transfer of the country's economy to a war footing, the new phase of the conflict looks unfavorable for Ukraine, the newspaper also points out. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia's special operation to protect Donbass, the launch of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022 due to the worsening situation in the region as a result of Ukrainian shelling.

"13 November 2023","The conflict in Ukraine should end according to the Vietnamese scenario, which provides for the complete liberation of the Ukrainian state from the intervention of Western countries, said on Monday, November 13, the chairman of the “We are together with Russia” movement, Vladimir Rogov. Earlier, on November 12, the former Supreme Commander of the Allied Armed Forces of NATO in In Europe, retired US Navy Admiral James Stavridis said in an article for Bloomberg that Ukraine would have to agree to the return of Crimea to Russia. He suggested that the current situation could develop according to the Korean scenario, because “as in the case of the Korean War, most likely, it will come down to a frozen conflict.” However, according to the head of the social movement, the so-called Korean scenario will not suit Russia, because Moscow does not need a freezing of the conflict, but a complete solution to it. “We do not need the Korean scenario, but the Vietnamese one, which provides for the complete liberation of Ukraine from the intervention of Western countries, and above all the Americans,” Rogov told RIA Novosti. There will be no breakthrough: Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny spoke about positional struggle In an essay for a British publication, the Ukrainian general made a number of compliments to Russian weapons. On November 13, State Duma deputy Mikhail Sheremet said that the Korean scenario for resolving the conflict in Ukraine is a trap. In particular, Kyiv and its Western partners want only a temporary freeze to turn the conflict into “a time bomb, capable of detonating at any moment with the snap of their fingers.” Journalist Anne Applebaum wrote in an article for The Atlantic on November 10 that the West suggests the possibility resolving the conflict in Ukraine according to the Korean scenario - that is, through the deployment of NATO military bases there. He recalled that in this case, the borders along the current front line will be frozen, and the rest of Ukraine will be protected by American security guarantees. After this, former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen on November 11 proposed admitting Ukraine to NATO within its new borders; he also stated that the alliance needs a new European security architecture, in which Ukraine will be at the center of NATO. Moreover, on October 5, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the Russian Federation has no goal of conquering the territory of Ukraine. According to him, the Ukrainian crisis is not a territorial conflict, and the Russian Federation is the largest country in the world and does not need any foreign territories. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Putin announced on February 24 last year, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

This was announced on Friday, March 31, by Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov. Earlier that day, Lukashenko proposed the format of an immediate truce in Ukraine. “Of course, we heard the statement of Alexander Grigorievich. Putin and Lukashenko will continue their communication next week, at a meeting of the Supreme Council of the Union State. This will give the presidents an opportunity to talk in detail with each other once again. “They will probably discuss this topic too,” Peskov said. At the same time, answering Izvestia’s clarifying question about Beijing’s peace plan, Peskov indicated that it is not on pause now. According to him, some provisions of the plan are still poorly implementable “due to the inability of the Ukrainian side to disobey their curators and commanders.” He added that in the context of Ukraine nothing changes, since a special military operation is the only means of achieving Russia’s goals. Two days earlier, Peskov stated that achieving the goals of the special operation through political and diplomatic means had become impossible. He also called for considering the situation in a broader context, taking into account the hybrid war unleashed by Western countries against Russia. Peskov noted that it could drag on for a long time, but the Russian Federation will continue to achieve its goals. “Until there is a corresponding decision from the United States, there will be no negotiations” Former Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov - on the possibility of dialogue between Moscow and Kyiv, further supplies of Western weapons and corruption in the country On March 31, Secretary General of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) Imangali Tasmagambetov emphasized that the West's supply of weapons to Ukraine negates the possibility of resolving the conflict through negotiations.

The latest face-to-face round of negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine took place on March 29 in Turkey. On October 4, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow.

"27 September 2023","Speaker of the US House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy on September 26 opposed the inclusion of a provision in the initiative to extend funding for the federal government of the country to allocate approximately $6 billion in aid to Ukraine. “If they want to focus on Ukraine and not on the southern border, I think they will their priorities are in the reverse order,” he said at a press conference. McCarthy noted that he considers the steps to include in this initiative a provision on the allocation of funds to help Kiev incorrect. He said that he had previously been to a number of American states that had suffered serious damage due to various natural disasters and disasters. According to him, the local population needs help. At the same time, senators put Ukraine above the Americans. “Why can’t we deal with the border and our emergency situations? Why is this a higher priority issue than what’s happening at the border?” - McCarthy added, speaking about the allocation of funds to help Kyiv. Unexpected guest: why did Blinken come to Ukraine for the fourth time? And is the United States interested in starting peace negotiations between Moscow and Kiev? Earlier this day, Reuters, citing a source, wrote that legislators in the US Senate have developed an initiative to extend funding for the American government to 17 November, which provides for the allocation of about $6 billion in assistance to Ukraine. At the same time, the White House had previously requested about $24 billion to help Kyiv. At the same time, ex-US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter told Izvestia about growing dissatisfaction with the support of Ukraine in Western countries.

"April 14 2023","Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said that American media are publishing more and more information about Kyiv’s supposedly impending counter-offensive. He expressed confidence in the failure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). He said this on April 13 on Channel One. “Now more and more information is appearing in the American media that a situation is about to arise when we will be attacked, that the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which received support from Washington, from Brussels, “ “they will tear apart the Russian front,” they will go out to the Sea of Azov again and isolate Crimea,” he said. Antonov emphasized that the Ukrainian Armed Forces “will not succeed.” According to him, the Russian army is capable of defeating the enemy, throwing him back, liberating “original Russian territories.” The ambassador also noted that the Russian diplomatic mission is trying to convey this thesis to the American side and calls on Washington to stop feeding Kyiv with weapons and money. The headquarters remembered: the Russian Armed Forces destroyed eight Ukrainian command posts. The Russian army makes it as difficult as possible to coordinate the actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the front line. Earlier on the same day, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) of Ukraine, Kirill Budanov, said that the Ukrainian Armed Forces need to demonstrate a successful counter-offensive, otherwise the taxpayers of the countries supporting Kyiv will face questions. He promised that Ukrainian militants will soon begin actions, “the results of which will be seen by everyone.” Also, the former head of the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) representative office in the Russian Federation, Rodion Miroshnik, believes that Washington is driving the Armed Forces of Ukraine “to slaughter”, wanting to receive political dividends and justify costs of assistance to Kyiv. At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities are “strongly manipulating” and seeking, under various pretexts, to push back the timing of the offensive. On April 11, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, commenting on statements that the leak of Pentagon documents was disrupting plans for a Ukrainian counter-offensive, said that Kiev has the ability to attack. Secretary The National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) of Ukraine, Alexey Danilov, said that the leak of classified Pentagon materials will not affect Kyiv’s military strategy, including counteroffensive plans. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal said that the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ counteroffensive could begin in the summer. According to him, Kyiv does not feel pressure from the West regarding a counter-offensive, since Western “friends” understand the importance of fully preparing the Ukrainian army. In turn, the head of the department of political analysis and socio-psychological processes of the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, Andrei Koshkin, allowed Ukraine to lie about postponing the counter-offensive for the summer. As military observer, retired colonel Viktor Litovkin told Izvestia, Ukraine has neither the forces nor the means for a counter-offensive. With the help of document leaks, the United States is trying to absolve itself of responsibility for the possible failure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ukrainian militants have few tanks, armored personnel carriers, trained crews, and not enough personnel. Also, the former head of the anti-aircraft missile forces of the special forces command of the Russian Air Force, reserve colonel Sergei Khatylev said that Ukrainian militants will not be able to carry out an effective counter-offensive, since they do not have enough manpower On April 10, the head of the defense committee of the Federation Council, Viktor Bondarev, said that the counteroffensive, which Kiev is intensively preparing, is doomed to failure. He recalled that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are severely depleted. Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov noted on April 7 that the Russian military carefully monitors all incoming information about the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and takes it into account when planning a special operation. This is how he commented on the statement of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken about a possible counter-offensive by Ukraine in the coming weeks. On the same day, the chairman of the “We are together with Russia” movement, Vladimir Rogov, said that the counter-offensive plan of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is supervised by Western countries. According to him, it was developed by the military from Great Britain and the United States. Prior to this, on March 30, the US White House stated that NATO intends to provide Ukraine with everything necessary for a possible counter-offensive. Kyiv's allies will discuss this at a ministerial meeting in Brussels. The American newspaper Politico reported on March 15 about the proposed offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which should begin in May. It is noted that Ukraine is considering two offensive scenarios. After this, Ukrainian army officer Valeriy Prozapas, in turn, indicated that due to a lack of forces and means, Kyiv would not be able to carry out a serious offensive in the Donbass. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of Russia’s special operation to protect the Donbass. The decision on the special operation was made by President Vladimir Putin against the backdrop of the worsening situation in the region due to increased shelling by Ukrainian troops.

"24 March 2023","Leopard and Abrams combat vehicles, sent to Ukraine the day before, will be easily hit by Russian weapons. This was stated by retired US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter in an interview with the US Tour of Duty YouTube channel. Since the beginning of the year, NATO countries have sent military equipment and ammunition to Ukraine, which will presumably be used in the spring counter-offensive in the southeast of the country. A former American intelligence officer shared his opinion that Kyiv would not be able to repel Moscow with such weapons. Moreover, ATGMs like the Kornet and T-90 tanks, which are in the arsenal of the Russian Armed Forces (RF Armed Forces), can easily undermine a foreign combat vehicle. According to the expert, the famous Abrams and Leopard are well known to the Russian forces. Due to many years of preparation for battle with this type of weapon, Russian troops have developed anti-tank systems capable of destroying British and German vehicles. As practice shows, the Russians know how to fight with all NATO equipment, the former officer emphasized. “All weapons supplied to the Ukrainians will be burned on the battlefield. People think that these brigades of Abrams, Challengers, Leopards, Marders, Bradleys and Strykers will attack together from the horizon and the Russians will magically surrender,” Ritter concluded. Strategic intent: The Ministry of Defense announced a plan to repel a NATO nuclear strike Who did the military assign the main role in a potential conflict One of the last decisions on Ukraine was made in the European Union on March 23 at a summit in Brussels. EU leaders supported the plan for the accelerated transfer of ammunition to Ukraine, as well as for joint purchases and increasing military production. Before this, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky addressed Western allied countries with a claim. According to him, states are not helping Ukraine properly, but instead are prolonging the fighting. He stressed that Kyiv needs new military aircraft and long-range weapons. On March 20, Zelensky called on Americans to continue supporting Kyiv in order to preserve a “normal society” while using Ukrainian, not American, military personnel. Speaking about the threat of a lack of arms supplies to Kyiv, Zelensky described a scenario that would lead to a direct clash between NATO and Russia. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which the Russian authorities announced on February 24, 2022 against the backdrop of an escalation of the situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

No runway: The United States will continue consultations on the supply of F-16s to Kiev Russia called the West's plans to send fighters to Ukraine a move towards escalation. Earlier this day, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that a decision on the supply of F-16 fighters to Kyiv has not yet been made, however The Netherlands is seriously considering this possibility. The Dutch Air Force has several dozen F-16 fighter jets. Currently, their replacement with fifth-generation F-35 fighter-bombers is ongoing. As the head of the French Foreign Ministry said on May 26, the country can help train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighters. The day before, Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin said that Denmark and the Netherlands will lead the EU coalition (EU) to train Ukrainian militants to fly the F-16. As military expert retired Colonel Viktor Litovki said on May 25, the American F-16 fighter is quite outdated and in many ways inferior to Russian aircraft. The advantage of Russian fighters is the ability to cover long distances and fly at higher speeds, he noted. Meanwhile, on May 23, the press service of the American Embassy in Moscow told Izvestia that the issue of supplying F-16s to Ukraine has not yet been resolved, the United States continues consultations with its allies and partners. This topic was on the agenda after the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. As the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, said, at the meeting, the G7 leaders finally decided to lay the foundations for the transfer of fighters to Kiev. The F-16 is an American fighter that is in service with many countries. Ukraine has been seeking to obtain this aircraft since the beginning of spring, when discussions began about preparing a counter-offensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Kyiv began to especially actively seek supplies after Russian aviation increased activity in the airspace.

"March 2024","The conflict between Ukraine and Poland in the trade sphere has brought benefits to Russia, and it did not provoke this crisis. The Politico newspaper reported this on March 6. The publication noted that problems with blocking the passage of Ukrainian transport with grain on the Polish-Ukrainian border emphasized Russia’s position as the world’s leading exporter of cereal crops. Russian agricultural products, according to Politico, move freely throughout Europe: for example, they are imported into Poland across the border with Belarus, and no obstacles are created for carriers there. As Gazeta.Ru adds, Poland itself is among the buyers of products from the Russian agricultural sector, and by this, in fact, blocks and isolates Ukraine, which he calls his ally. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk blamed Russian imports for the losses of Polish farmers and the crisis at the border, but Politico noted that there is nothing to prove his words. The publication recalled that in January Latvia tried to achieve a ban on the import of agricultural products from the Russian Federation throughout the European Union (EU), but failed because other states, such as Spain and Italy, were not ready to impose such an embargo because they are large buyers of Russian grain and cannot refuse it. Politico also emphasizes that Russian food is not subject to Western sanctions that prohibit the purchase and import of energy resources and some other goods from the Russian Federation. The border is locked: Poland has threatened to stop the transit of goods from Ukraine According to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, such a measure will be painful for both countries. Earlier, on March 6, Polish Minister of Agriculture Czeslaw Sekierski said that Warsaw and Kyiv are trying to avoid a complete closure of the common border for cargo transportation. There is currently an embargo on wheat, sunflower, corn and rapeseed, but further bans, he said, will harm the Polish economy. Polish farmers regularly block roads in the republic. On March 1, they blocked local highway No. 15 and demanded a meeting with the Prime Minister of their country, Donald Tusk. They added that they are not afraid of the police and do not want to see Deputy Minister of Agriculture Michal Kolodziejczak. Farmers are demanding the introduction of an embargo on the supply of agricultural products from Ukraine and the state’s withdrawal from the EU Green Deal program, which concerns the achievement of carbon neutrality in the alliance countries by 2050. At six checkpoints on the Polish-Ukrainian border on February 27, there were a total of 2, 1 thousand trucks that were stuck due to blocked checkpoints. Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine Alexander Kubrakov said that on February 25, unknown persons poured approximately 160 tons of Ukrainian grain from sealed wagons, which were being transported to the port of Gdansk. He called the incident “impunity and irresponsibility,” recalling that this is the fourth such case. Polish carriers and farmers began blocking automobile checkpoints on the border with Ukraine in early November last year. Among their demands was the introduction of commercial permits for Ukrainian carriers and a limit on the number of Ukrainian heavy trucks entering Poland.

Bloomberg reported this on December 18, citing a letter from Pentagon Comptroller Michael McCord to members of the US Congress. “The Pentagon said it will run out of money to replace weapons sent to Ukraine by December 30 if Congress does not approve new funding,” it says in the publication. The agency drew attention to the fact that the American military department spoke for the first time about the exact date of exhaustion of resources to support the Kyiv regime. It is noted that the remaining budget, which, according to Pentagon estimates, is estimated at $1.07 billion, will purchase various weapons and equipment. Most of the amount - $635 million - will be spent on the purchase of missiles, $210 million - on spare 155-mm M795 high-explosive fragmentation shells, fuses, primers and various gunpowder. There will also be other purchases. “Once these funds are allocated, the Department will exhaust available funding to help ensure the security of Ukraine,” McCord said in the letter.

"February 5 2024","Ukraine may disappear from the world map if American Republican congressmen do not support the US Senate bill to support it and continue to expect the return of former American leader Donald Trump to the White House. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer pointed this out on MSNBC on February 5. “Too many Republicans, including Speaker [of the House of Representatives Mike] Johnson, are deathly afraid of Donald Trump, who says, 'Let's wait until I'm president,' which will take at least a year. During this time, Ukraine could disappear,” he said. Schumer noted that senators must “shut down the political noise” from Trump and his supporters. “Can senators drown out the political noise from Trump and his cronies and do the right thing for America? This is a very important question. History is now looking down on each of us,"" he said. According to Schumer, the situation at the border could also get significantly worse while waiting for Trump to take office. ""We have made it very clear what the demands of the House of Representatives are, and they are that to solve the problem at the border,” he said, adding that the House is “awaiting” action from the Senate. They won’t be able to pull it out: the West is trying to prolong the conflict in Ukraine Why the US and EU countries need this and who will pay Kyiv’s bills The day before, the US Senate introduced a bill that would allocate money for border security and assistance to Ukraine and Israel.

The Bild newspaper wrote about this on Monday, July 10. The material notes that Zelensky planned to submit an official request for the country’s admission to the alliance at the upcoming NATO summit in Vilnius. “He is now extremely angry that he was not allowed to do this,” — the article says. It is noted that Ukraine’s accession to the alliance is supported by many of its members, but the United States and Germany have a different opinion and “pressure other NATO members to join their position,” Gazeta.Ru reports. Authors of the article indicated that Germany would not agree with the language about “inviting” Ukraine to NATO or its “legitimate place” in the alliance in the final document of the summit in Vilnius. At the same time, the source told the publication that Germany and the United States plan to sign a new declaration with the Ukrainian side , which, according to him, “hardly goes beyond the framework of what was adopted in Bucharest in 2008.” According to the authors of the material, this means support for Ukraine’s entry into NATO without any specifics. The NATO summit will be held in Vilnius July 11–12. Someday later: why Ukraine is not being accepted into NATO The Alliance has promised Kyiv a new aid package, but there is no talk of joining. Also on Monday, Denis Denisov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, in a conversation with Izvestia, noted that, in his opinion, NATO summit will offer Ukraine a “slogan document” that will not oblige either the United States or the alliance itself to anything.

He noted that he discussed this topic with the Ukrainian president. The American leader proposed other ways to ensure security and promised arms supplies. Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov, in turn, said that Ukraine’s potential entry into NATO will require a fairly clear and firm reaction from Russia. He recalled Russia’s position that Ukraine’s membership in the alliance would have very negative consequences. Earlier, on June 27, Zelensky drew attention to the fact that there are reasons for inviting the country to become a member of NATO, but did not voice them. The Ukrainian president noted that he has a full understanding of the country's security guarantees before it joins the alliance. On September 30, 2022, Ukraine submitted an application to join NATO on an accelerated basis. Then Zelensky said that in fact Ukraine is already in NATO and meets the standards of the alliance.

"21 January 2024","Ukraine will not be able to do without additional mobilization to continue hostilities, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Kirill Budanov, said on January 21. “It’s unthinkable to even think that we can do without mobilization. The shortage [of military personnel in the Ukrainian army] is noticeable,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. Moreover, Budanov does not consider the counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) to be a complete failure. According to the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, in this case there was no disaster for Kyiv. Save ordinary Biden: why Kyiv is tightening mobilization And how the recruitment of 500 thousand people into the Armed Forces of Ukraine affects the presidential campaign in the United States Earlier, on January 11, The Times newspaper suggested that because of the new mobilization bill, even more citizens will flee Ukraine. It was noted that against the background of heavy losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, fewer and fewer Ukrainians are ready to fight for the country, and since the beginning of the Ukrainian conflict, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained more than 17 thousand people trying to illegally cross the border. Prior to this, on January 9, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu stated that in 2023 the Ukrainian army lost at least 215 thousand people. Even earlier, on January 6, the Ukrainian publication Strana.ua noted that the new law on mobilization will affect Ukrainians who have left for other countries, although legislators have not decided on the conditions and requirements for potential fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On January 3, adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, Mikhail Podolyak, announced difficulties in carrying out mobilization. According to him, there is a tough discussion in Ukrainian society on this matter, but Kyiv has no choice. At the end of December 2023, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers submitted to the Verkhovna Rada a new bill on mobilization in the country. Among other things, it is proposed to exclude military service as a type and remove the category of limited suitability for military service. Martial law in Ukraine has been in effect since February 2022. At the same time, Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization. Later, the Rada repeatedly extended its validity.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated this on August 19 in an interview with the magazine “International Affairs.” “Their (Western investors. - Ed.) faith in its (Ukraine. - Ed.) military successes and in general in the preservation of this state in any forms and boundaries. Not to mention the fact that Kyiv’s ability to service its national debt is in big question,” he said. Since February 2022, Western assistance to Ukraine has amounted to $160 billion, of which $75 billion was transferred for military purposes. The United States, in particular, allocated $113 billion to Kyiv—that’s $900 from each household. Counter-offensive on Ukraine: why the West is talking about a truce with Russia Kyiv is preparing for a “difficult political season” The day before, a member of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Maria Butina, expressed the opinion that US interest in the situation around Ukraine is beginning to disappear; at present, the Americans have enough problems inside countries. Americans' attention has shifted from Ukraine to the consequences of devastating forest fires, inflation problems and the trials of former US President Donald Trump and the son of the current leader of the country Hunter Biden, she specified. On July 21, Lieutenant Colonel of the US Army Daniel Davis, in a publication for 19FortyFive, pointed out that Ukrainians face a difficult fate, regardless of the outcome of the conflict. Economically, humanitarianly and militarily, it will be difficult for the country to survive, let alone prosper, he said. According to Davis, even if the situation develops as successfully as possible for Kyiv - in particular, if foreign allies are able to provide the necessary material support (and this will be talking about trillions of dollars) - you need to understand that for the normal functioning of the state, not only money will be required. Prior to this, on July 13, Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmygal said that the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the EU countries plan to transfer more than €400 million to Ukraine According to him, first of all, the funds will be used to restore critical infrastructure.

"25 July 2023","President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky called the decision on the possible extension of restrictions on the export of Ukrainian agricultural products to some EU countries after September 15 unacceptable and un-European. After the meeting on July 24, he recorded a video in which he expressed hope for a rational decision by Europe, noting his readiness for any development of events. “We have an agreement with the European Commission on September 15 as the deadline for restrictions on our grain exports, and we hope that the European side will fulfill its obligations. Because any continuation of restrictions is absolutely unacceptable and frankly un-European. Europe has the institutional opportunity to act more rationally than to close borders to this or that product. We will try to find a solution that will meet the spirit of our Europe,” he said in a video message published on his Telegram channel. According to the Ukrainian president, Kyiv is actively working to find a solution on this issue. Zelensky expects that European countries will fulfill their obligations and restrictions will cease to apply. National grain: Eastern Europe bans the import of Ukrainian wheat Will this force the EU to reconsider approaches to the deal and relations with Russia On July 21, Bloomberg, citing Ukrainian Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food Nikolai Solsky, reported that food exports from Ukraine fell by at least 30% after termination of the grain deal. The minister added that many suppliers switched to deliveries by truck or by rail. However, in early July, Doctor of Science and Professor at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences Arkadiusz Artyszak said that Poland was literally flooded with imported grains, especially wheat and corn from Ukraine. He referred to data from the Ministry of Finance and the National Tax Administration. On May 31, it was reported that Hungary asked the EU to extend restrictions on the import of Ukrainian grain for five Eastern European countries at least until the end of 2023. On May 2, the European Commission banned the export of Ukrainian grain to five Eastern European countries. The restrictive measures taken affect the export of four agricultural products - wheat, corn, rapeseed and sunflower seeds of Ukrainian origin. Last year, the EU allowed Kyiv to supply food to EU countries duty-free, but this hit farmers in Poland and some other countries.

This was stated by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on April 7 during negotiations with his Turkish counterpart Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. Also, according to him, Western statements on peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine are “unclean tactics.” Lavrov emphasized that Russia has repeatedly said that it does not refuse negotiations. “But these negotiations can only be based on taking into account Russian legitimate interests, Russian legitimate concerns, which we have been setting out for many, many years, identifying in dialogue with our Western colleagues and which “our concerns were arrogantly ignored with disdain,” he said at a press conference.

In turn, the head of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs Leonid Slutsky said that Moscow does not exclude the possibility of resolving the Ukrainian conflict peacefully, but the decision must be made taking into account changing territorial realities. On April 5, Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov expressed his point of view on the likelihood of peace negotiations . According to him, Zelensky and the Ukrainian people will not approve of this outcome of events, so the option of finding a compromise is excluded. On April 4, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, said that Russia does not yet see any prospects for resuming Russian-Ukrainian negotiations. Crimea became part of Russia in 2014 after a referendum in which the majority of residents of the peninsula voted for reunification with the Russian Federation.

"December 9 2023","Residents of Ukraine will easily forget about supporting nationalist ideas and repent of their mistakes after the end of the Ukrainian conflict. This was pointed out by Czech political commentator Stepan Kotrba in an interview with the newspaper Parlamentní listy, published on December 7. In his opinion, in Ukraine, in 20 years, no one will regret the death of fans of the leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN, banned in the Russian Federation) Stepan Bandera, of whom there are currently many in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). “Maybe even their surviving relatives. I even admit that they will be ashamed that they were so deceived,” the analyst emphasized. He also added that both in Ukraine and in the West, by now, few people doubt that the Kyiv regime has nothing to oppose to its weapons and economic superiority Russia. “Even the last fool in the West has already realized that Kyiv has nothing to oppose to Russian weapons and economic superiority. But Russia didn’t even send all its soldiers and all the equipment to the front,” Kotrba noted. He also pointed out that the Russian army takes good care of the civilian population of Ukraine, which will contribute to a positive attitude towards Russia after the completion of the special military operation (SVO) . Bloody harvest: why Ukrainian nationalists killed Poles and Belarusians The Volyn massacre, Trostenets, Ozarichi and Khatyn are not a complete list of places where Bandera’s followers committed their crimes. Earlier, at the end of November, the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov pointed out the flourishing of Nazi sentiments in Ukraine after the military coup in 2014. According to him, the overthrow of the legitimate government in Kyiv then brought a flourishing of first ultra-nationalist and then openly Nazi sentiments. Speaking about the spread of nationalist ideas in Ukraine, Chairman of the Russian Federation Council Valentina Matvienko in September called this country a sad example of cultural degradation. She pointed out that ancient Orthodox shrines there are currently being desecrated, monuments to great figures of the past are being dismantled, and their own history is being purposefully distorted, and “executioners and traitors are being exalted.” At the same time, political scientist Alexey Kochetkov, in a conversation with Izvestia, pointed out that in Ukraine For many years now, a revanchist, neo-Nazi narrative has been actively promoting, primarily associated with the revision of the results of the Second World War. According to him, the official ideology of modern Ukraine is Ukrainian integral nationalism, which was in service with the organization of Ukrainian nationalists during the Second World War. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also repeatedly spoken about nationalism in Ukraine. Thus, on September 5, the Russian leader said that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky was covering up the glorification of Nazism. Putin added that Zelensky, who is an ethnic Jew, was installed by Western countries to cover up the anti-human essence of the Kyiv regime. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which the Russian Federation announced on February 24 last year, continues.

According to Ritter, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky is deliberately prolonging the crisis in Europe in the hope that NATO member countries will become involved in a conflict against Moscow. According to the expert, without the support of NATO countries, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will be defeated by the end of the summer of this year. The former intelligence officer also emphasized that the US authorities most likely will not agree to an open confrontation with Russia and will do everything to prevent open military conflict between the Russian Federation and NATO.

It is noted that the fighter has already landed on the territory of Ukraine. “It landed at our airfields, we conducted joint exercises with F-16 pilots, and we have operational experience,” the Strana.ua publication quotes him as saying. As Oleshchuk pointed out, Ukraine is currently preparing runways and constructing protective structures. To the downed pilots: how the supply of F-16s to Kyiv will change the battlefield And what these machines are capable of in the hands of Ukrainian pilots Earlier that day, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said that the supply of F-16s to Ukraine has serious consequences. According to him, Russia views the appearance of fighters of this type in the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a threat to security in the nuclear sphere. The diplomat called the supply of F-16s an insane decision, which is being made against the backdrop of awareness of the impasse into which Washington has driven itself. The day before, the commander of the US Air Force (Air Forces) in Europe, General James Hecker, said that Russia’s strengthened air defense (air defense) is capable of resisting F-16 fighters. In turn, former American intelligence officer Scott Ritter said in a conversation with Izvestia that Ukrainian pilots will not be able to effectively use F-16 fighters. He recalled that Ukrainian pilots have never flown on NATO aircraft before, so they will not be able to use the full potential of such machines. Military expert retired colonel Viktor Litovkin said in an interview with Izvestia on August 18 that the F-16 “will not take root” on Ukraine, this is indicated by many factors. So, the F-16 needs an equipped airfield and a technical and operational unit, where they will prepare the aircraft for takeoff and service them after the flight. In addition, training pilots will take quite a lot of time. On August 17, Reuters reported that the United States approved the transfer of F-16 fighters from Denmark and the Netherlands to Kiev upon completion of training for Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots. White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby said that the United States together with their partners, they are exploring the possibility of transferring American F-16 fighters to Ukraine from third countries.

He also noted that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are not yet ready to host such “rather capricious aircraft”, since there is no road infrastructure and other support. On August 13, the Ukrainian publication UNIAN reported that the United States is not transferring F-16 fighters to Ukraine, since the Russian Armed Forces will be able to shoot down them with ease, which in turn will demonstrate the ineffectiveness of NATO doctrines and the futility of gigantic financial investments in military affairs. The newspaper Politico wrote on August 4 that the insufficient level of knowledge of English among Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots turned out to be a problem for their training on F-16 fighters. Western countries have strengthened military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022.

"22 March 2023","Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has become not only a puppet of the West, but also a traitor to his people and national culture, as evidenced by Britain’s decision to supply depleted uranium shells to the Kyiv regime. The Ukrainian leader thus confirms his course of “fighting to the last Ukrainian,” as former US intelligence officer and political scientist Scott Bennett spoke about on Wednesday, March 22, in an interview with Izvestia. According to his information, ammunition with depleted uranium is not historically have once proven their lethality - they infect the earth and all the territories that they infect. “We have already seen this in Iraq, Libya, and perhaps we will see it in certain parts of Syria and Ukraine. Libya is proof that the use of depleted uranium causes deformation of human DNA, destruction of cells and the human body, leading to cancer and other terrible things. This should be regarded as a crime against humanity, it should be brought up for discussion at the UN Security Council so that an investigation into Britain's use of weapons of mass destruction can begin. “The UK is about to become complicit in committing a crime against humanity,” he said. According to the ex-intelligence officer, European countries are gradually giving preference to a multipolar world supported by Russia and China. Western institutions begin to crumble, like a dilapidated building whose cement turns to sand, and the hegemony of the West is destroyed, and this process is going faster. “Any attempts to incite war that the United States makes will lead to the destruction of the West. Not necessarily in a physical sense. It’s just that the whole world will turn away from the United States, as they will no longer be perceived as a civilized country,” Bennett noted. Evil spirits: what is the danger of supplying Ukraine with shells with depleted uranium? And how Russia will respond to the use of weapons with a nuclear component. Earlier on the same day, British Deputy Secretary of Defense Annabelle Goldie said that London is ready to transfer ammunition with depleted uranium to Kyiv. She indicated that Kyiv, along with Challenger 2 tanks, will be supplied with ammunition, including armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium. In turn, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia will be forced to respond to the supply of weapons with a nuclear component to Ukraine. As the Russian leader pointed out, the West thus confirmed its intention to fight until the last Ukrainian. In 1999, such ammunition was used during the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO troops. As professor and toxicologist Radomir Kovacevic said in July last year, another 60 future generations of Serbs will experience negative consequences for their health due to the depleted uranium shells used. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass .

"June 2023","France can hardly be considered one of the countries that remain neutral on the topic of the situation in Ukraine and can lay claim to the role of moderator of the conflict. This was stated on June 3 by Kremlin official representative Dmitry Peskov, commenting on Western media reports that French leader Emmanuel Macron came up with the idea of holding a peace summit on Ukraine in Paris. At the same time, Peskov recalled the position of Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine. “President Putin was, is and will be open to any contacts in order to achieve solutions to our problems by means other than a special military operation. But these same Western countries currently leave us no other choice,” the Kremlin representative emphasized in the “Moscow. Kremlin. Putin.” As Peskov noted, France is an active participant in the Ukrainian conflict. “France can hardly be classified as a neutral country that can lay claim to the role of moderator, well, say, like Brazil, like China, like African countries, like the Vatican. France cannot do this, because it is already de facto an active participant in the conflict, and on the part of Ukraine. And the French must be aware of this,” Peskov said. As he noted, now the Ukrainian conflict has truly become wider, since the collective West has begun to wage a combined war against Russia. And in this case, it is futile for Western countries to resolve the conflict. Peskov also believes that we need to wait for any clarification from the French leader himself. They said it all: Western leaders spoke openly about the conflict in Ukraine What the recent statements of European politicians actually were. On June 2, the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov noted that Russia does not see the prerequisites for moving on to dialogue on the conflict issue, since Western countries do not accept taking into account the goals of the Russian Federation. Earlier, on May 31, a high-ranking French official spoke out against the use of military aid supplied to Ukraine against Russia. He noted that the allies are unanimous in the need to supply the Kiev regime with weapons, but split on the issue of using military assistance for attacks on Russian territory.

The day before, the British publication The Daily Telegraph, citing sources, reported that Great Britain would sign a ten-year security pact with Ukraine in the coming weeks, within the framework of which London would share military and maritime experience to fight Russia. “Everything looks funny, because Great Britain has a fleet, but Ukraine does not. It is not clear how English sailors will share their experience with Ukraine. How to repeat this experience if Ukraine does not have a fleet? This is great stupidity. Well, the British received some money for this purpose, to share experience with Ukraine, well, they will conduct several briefings and classes with Ukrainian sailors, but Ukraine does not have ships. Therefore, this whole experience is in vain. This is all an attempt to maintain tension such that we, the British, can.

The White House is allowing future deliveries, but not in the near future, spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said at a briefing on September 22. “I am not going to comment on existing publications. The President has previously said that ATACMS are not being ruled out. But I don’t have any new information about this,” she said. In general terms, Jean-Pierre agreed to add that the bilateral meeting between Presidents [of Ukraine Vladimir] Zelensky and Biden demonstrated to the world the firm commitment of the United States to support Ukraine. Colleague Jean-Pierre from the Pentagon, Department spokesman General Patrick Ryder, when asked about the timing of missile delivery, replied that he had “nothing to announce.” “I’m not going to get ahead of myself with this announcement. What you can expect from the [military aid to Ukraine] package is an increase in air defense and artillery capabilities to support the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

"July 2023","Peace in Ukraine can only be achieved on Russia’s terms, says French politician and member of the European Parliament Hervé Juven. He expressed this opinion in an interview with Stratpol on July 6. According to him, a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian conflict is still possible, but for this the West must accept Russia’s demands, which directly affect the country’s national security issues. “Europe must move towards establishing peace. First of all, we need a ceasefire, security guarantees for the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine and the non-deployment of American missiles near the borders of Russia,” he noted. The politician expressed the conviction that such a peace agreement would provide security guarantees to both Kyiv and Moscow. At the same time, Juven voiced his opinion that the European Union (EU) is ""severely weakened"" for such intractability by the energy crisis and the impact of sanctions, and its economic situation is extremely dismal. There are exceptions in detente: will Kherson and Zaporozhye be included in the negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine In the near future, experts do not see prerequisites for resuming dialogue On July 1, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said that Kyiv will be ready for a peaceful dialogue with Russia when the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will reach the borders of 1991. He called the border of February 24, 2022 a contact line, so access to it will not lead to the start of peace negotiations. Meanwhile, First Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Vladimir Dzhabarov, in a conversation with Izvestia, emphasized that for Russia, conversations about borders in 1991 years are absolutely unacceptable, since Crimea and all four new regions, according to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, are Russian lands. Earlier, on May 23, Federation Council Senator Sergei Tsekov noted that if peace was important to Zelensky, he would agree to negotiations with Moscow without preconditions , however, if the Ukrainian president takes such a step, he will lose Western support. Russia continues to carry out a special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"22 July 2023","University of Texas professor and historian Jeremy Suri said on July 20 that Russia and China are actively establishing ties with Cuba, creating a “trap” for the United States. He recalled that Moscow is increasing diplomatic, economic and, allegedly, military ties with Havana. Air traffic between the countries has also recently been restored. In addition, the historian highlighted the visit to Cuba by the Russian Navy training ship Perekop. As Suri noted, Cuba allegedly allowed China to build a “spy base” on its territory to conduct electronic reconnaissance. However, Beijing denies this information. “Military escalation around Cuba is a dangerous temptation for Russia and a complex trap for the United States,” the historian wrote in an article for CNN. Suri indicated that Washington considers the strengthening of Cuba’s relations with Russia and China a threat to national security. In this regard, the White House advocates limiting support for Havana from Moscow and Beijing. According to the professor, against the background of this, there is a risk of a repetition of the Cuban missile crisis. Putin named the priorities of cooperation with Cuba and touched upon the topic of Western sanctions pressure in a conversation with the prime minister of the island state. Earlier, on July 4, the Russian Ambassador to Havana, Victor Coronelli, said that automakers were negotiating the supply of cars to Cuba. The day before, the director of the department of the national payment system of the Central Bank (CB ) Alla Bakina said in an interview with Izvestia that the Cuban side is setting up POS terminals to ensure they accept Mir cards. The first regular flight to Cuba after the break took off from Moscow on July 1. As passengers told Izvestia, for many the resumption of air traffic was welcome. The fact that regular flights between the countries were resuming became known on May 19. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko stated that air traffic was being resumed on instructions from Russian President Vladimir Putin. He emphasized that Cuba is Russia’s key partner in Central America. On June 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting in the Kremlin with Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz, expressed confidence that relations between the two countries will develop in all areas, including areas of energy and tourism. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko was in Cuba on May 17–19 as part of a working trip. Together with Cuban Deputy Prime Minister Ricardo Cabrisas, he chaired the 20th meeting of the Russian-Cuban intergovernmental commission. On May 20, Chernyshenko announced Moscow’s intention to develop cooperation with Havana in the agro-industrial complex. He also drew attention to the fact that the main interaction between the Russian Federation and Cuba is in the energy sector.

The woman does not have her own children; she is raising adopted children. When crossing the border, 10 children aged from 4 to 16 years old were with her. The children told the volunteers that the woman abused them. Polish human rights activist Joanna Pachvicevich on May 3, in an interview with Izvestia, expressed the opinion that children from orphanages in Ukraine are being sold to Europe in order to make money from them.

Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson said this on Monday, July 10, to the Judging Freedom YouTube channel. “The controversial question is what will happen to Ukraine after December. “I believe that it has no chance of continuing military operations due to casualties among personnel and a shortage of weapons,” he said. The US decision to supply cluster munitions to Ukraine, according to Johnson, is due to the depletion of American artillery shell stocks. According to him, the Americans will not be able to organize their production to meet the needs of Ukrainian troops in the future.

He added that the West is ready to supply Kyiv with weapons and ammunition in the coming months to replace those destroyed and used by Russia, and in the future, air defense systems will remain the priority for military supplies. Money and weapons: who is helping Ukraine and how The total Western costs of supporting Kyiv have already exceeded €90 billion.

He also emphasized that over 2.5 thousand foreign mercenaries are involved in punitive actions and hostilities. Prior to this, on April 19, US Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said that the Ukrainian conflict showed that the American assessment of the use of ammunition in armed conflicts was underestimated.

The head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, announced this on Wednesday, August 30. “I proposed creating a fund from 2024 to 2027 that would work within the framework of the European Peace Fund. This must be a key element of our support for Ukraine. Within the framework of the fund, we will provide €5 billion every year,” Borrell said at a press conference following an informal meeting of the heads of the EU countries’ defense forces in Toledo. The head of European diplomacy also proposed increasing the number of Ukrainian military personnel who will undergo training in the EU this year. So, if earlier the European Union planned to train 30 thousand military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), now this figure can be increased to 40 thousand, Borrell said. “Currently, the number of military personnel trained within the EU’s European training mission is 25 thousand people. <…> I proposed to the ministers to increase the training target from 30 to 40 thousand by the end of this year,” he said. Counterattack number two: why Kyiv is assembling a new army Ukrainian authorities have abandoned the truce and are preparing a new wave of mobilization Earlier this day it became known that Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur called on his colleagues at a meeting in Toledo to increase spending on supporting Ukraine.

Russian Senator Alexei Pushkov stated this on August 5. In particular, he noted, Brasilia stated that it makes no sense to make any decision regarding a settlement in Ukraine without the participation of the Russian side. “Because of all this, the summit could turn in a direction unexpected for the United States “: instead of supporting the “peace formula” of [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky, countries of the non-Western world can offer their vision of the crisis and ways out of it, including those that take into account Russia’s security interests,” he wrote in the Telegram channel. A meeting without a proposal: why the summit on Ukraine in Jeddah is doomed to failure Its organizers hope to gather representatives from about 30 countries, some have already refused to discuss the conflict without Russia. A day earlier, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that the country would send Chinese Special Representative for Eurasian Affairs Li Hui to an international meeting on the Ukrainian issue in Saudi Arabia. China is ready to work with the international community to continue to play a constructive role in finding a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis, the department said in a statement. On this day, Saudi Arabia confirmed holding consultations on peace negotiations on the Ukrainian conflict in Jeddah.

However, he expressed the opinion that this is another opportunity to enlist the support of the international community regarding Kiev’s peace plan. As Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of the magazine “Russia in Global Affairs” noted to Izvestia, the negotiations in Jeddah will not have any influence on the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. Participating countries meet for other purposes. Thus, in his opinion, Saudi Arabia aims to demonstrate its significance on the international stage, and over the past few years, Riyadh has managed to transform from a country that was perceived exclusively as a client and satellite of the United States into a state with fairly independent views. In addition In addition, on August 2, the special representative of the Brazilian President for International Affairs, Celso Amorim, announced the lack of consensus around the “peace formula” proposed by Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky. Back in November 2022, President Zelensky presented 10 points of his formula for establishing peace.

"April 28 2023","The Sun journalist Tariq Tahir is delighted with the capabilities of the T-14 Armata tank in Ukraine. He wrote about this on April 25 in his article on the combat vehicle. He writes that the tank is equipped with a powerful cannon with a firing range of five miles. Tariq Tahir especially highlights the characteristic of the machine, which concerns the invisibility of the machine for radars - this is a special stealth coating. “The Russians also specially developed a camouflage agent for the T-14 called “Mantle”, which absorbs radar waves, repelling and simultaneously scattering them. The heat signature of operating engines is reduced to background levels, so one is blurred by the other, reducing its ability to detect. As a result, the vehicle is no longer visible to weapons such as the US military's Javelin homing warheads, which use thermal detection to engage targets,” Tahir states in his piece. The author claims that the tanks are equipped with lattice armor that protects them from precision-guided anti-tank weapons and close combat weapons, such as hand-held anti-tank grenade launchers. Noel Sharkey, a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield, told the publication that the firepower of a tank could devastate cities in a matter of minutes.

He also noted that Hungary will not allow the EU to impose sanctions against Russian nuclear energy, since such a step would harm the interests of Budapest. Expendable business: Hungary opposes new funding for Ukraine And calls for the start of peace negotiations Earlier, on November 10, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban noted that Ukraine is in all respects not ready to begin negotiations on its membership in the EU. He also stressed that Hungary would never agree to link the issue of financing Ukraine from the EU budget, as well as its admission into the community with the return of frozen money from European funds to Budapest. The day before, Bloomberg reported that the EU countries were working on a plan for financing Ukraine in case Hungary will veto a €50 billion aid package. The proposal would include national guarantees from member states to attract funding from markets. On October 26, Orban said his country was ready to reach an agreement with Kiev on the allocation of funds from the EPF. To do this, the NAPC delegation must come to Budapest to discuss the situation around OTR Bank. He clarified that until this issue is resolved, Ukraine will not receive a tranche from the fund. In early October, Kyiv, following negotiations with Budapest, excluded OTR Bank from the “list of war sponsors.” In Kyiv, they noted that they did this to stop Hungary’s blocking of the European Union’s provision of military assistance to Kyiv in the amount of €500 million. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which the Russian authorities announced on February 24, 2022 amid the aggravation situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

It’s true that Crimea was part of Russia,” Oleynik said. In addition, according to the political scientist, “a diplomat of this level would not make a gag” and, probably, a similar point of view is in the Chinese Foreign Ministry. “It’s just the Chinese ambassador himself.” said that not everything is so simple <...>. If he had spoken differently, for example, with territorial claims to Russia, everyone would have even applauded <...>. He simply spoke out in connection with a real conflict, which is located in a territory where the Russian-speaking population lives very densely,” Oleynik added. “The West is not in a position to give instructions to China” Chinese Ambassador to the Russian Federation Zhang Hanhui on Beijing’s views on the Ukrainian crisis, the formula for relations with Moscow and cars on the Russian market Earlier, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Ukraine sharply condemned Liu Shaye’s words about ownership Crimea. The Chinese Ambassador told the French TV channel LCI that the republic originally belonged to Russia and became part of the Ukrainian SSR only in 1954. On April 21, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that Beijing has always taken an objective and fair position regarding the Ukrainian crisis. He also emphasized that no state has the right to interfere in relations between Russia and China. On February 24, China published a document with a position on a political settlement of the situation in Ukraine. Its goal is to continue its constructive role in resolving the crisis and achieving peace. On February 27, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said that the Kremlin cannot imagine the circumstances of the return of Crimea to Ukraine. Crimea became part of Russia in 2014 after a referendum in which the majority of residents peninsula voted for reunification with the Russian Federation. Kyiv refuses to recognize the results of the vote and considers Crimea its territory. The Russian leadership has repeatedly stated that the residents of the republic voted for reunification democratically and the question of the ownership of the peninsula is finally closed.

This was reported by Foreign Policy with reference to Ukrainian MP Alexandra Ustinova. “Ukraine hoped to launch an offensive in April, but due to a shortage of weapons, the start date was postponed indefinitely,” the publication quotes her in a material published on April 20. It is noted that the counter-offensive The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) is impossible without additional supplies of artillery and tanks from Western countries. According to the publication, Ukrainian officials are concerned that the delays are increasingly hampering Kyiv's plans and allowing the Russian military to adapt its tactics. “Russian ships, equipped with longer-range missiles, fire precision-guided munitions, making a Ukrainian counter-offensive impossible. Russian fourth-generation fighters can also fire from Russian airspace,” Foreign Policy said. One Ukrainian official also told the magazine that delivery of the aircraft Kyiv needs is not expected in the coming months. Raise supplies: will Kyiv receive weapons for a counteroffensive? The 11th meeting of the contact group on Ukraine was held in Germany at the American Ramstein base. On April 21, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that Ukraine, with the current level of NATO support, can achieve success in a counteroffensive when it finds the means to do so. right moment. He also expressed confidence that Kyiv one way or another needs powerful help from the West. According to the press secretary's forecasts, a Kiev counter-offensive is expected in about a month. At the same time, on April 16, The Washington Post wrote that US officials recognize the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have enough ammunition for a successful counter-offensive. About the alleged offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is about to begin in May, on March 15, the American newspaper Politico reported. It was noted that Ukraine is considering two offensive scenarios. Moscow has repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Ukraine. Thus, on January 16, Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov stated that a new round of supplies of more advanced military equipment to Ukraine could “only delay the whole story.” The West has strengthened military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022 amid the worsening situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

"30 September 2023","Germany went all-in by agreeing to supply Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine. Pavel Danilov, director of the Center for Applied Analysis of International Transformations of the RUDN University, stated this on September 30. “It is assumed that the Germans have decided everything for themselves. Germany did not dare to do this, as it is focused on returning business to Russia. The economy has been undermined by the destruction of the Nord Streams and the cessation of energy supplies. The Germans in parliament say that we need to go all-in, we need to supply Ukraine with everything that is allowed by international law, including Taurus,” he said. According to the expert, these missiles carry a payload of about 500 kg and have a flight range of up to 500 km. However, they were purchased for the Bundeswehr 30 years ago. “About 600 missiles are in warehouses, of which 150–200 are ready for use. Back in Soviet times, we quite calmly worked out options for shooting down these missiles. We have learned to cope with them,” Danilov pointed out. He also drew attention to the fact that the German political elite does not want to raise rates, but the United States is forcing them to do so. Radius of inaction: the German Foreign Minister discussed Taurus deliveries in Kyiv. How much Berlin has already spent on supporting Ukraine and why Annalena Bärbock is worried about corruption in the country. Earlier that day, the chairman of the Bundestag defense committee, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, said that international law allows Ukraine to attack military targets on Russian territory. She said that she would increase pressure on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to supply Taurus to Kiev. On September 28, Mikhail Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, said that the transfer of long-range Western ATACMS and Taurus missiles to Ukraine would not compensate for the difference in the number of Russian weapons on the battlefield. Prior to this, on September 26, the head of the Bundestag committee on economics and climate protection from the Left party, Klaus Ernst, in a conversation with Izvestia, said that he had a negative attitude towards possible deliveries of Taurus to Ukraine. According to the German politician, Kyiv will break its promise not to use missiles to attack Russian territory. On September 15, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that the decision to transfer Taurus missiles to Ukraine could be made within up to two weeks. He called on the Ukrainian authorities to understand this decision-making procedure. At the same time, on September 11, the head of the German Defense Ministry claimed that Germany would not supply these missiles to Ukraine. Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 by Russian leader Vladimir Putin after the situation worsened in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

This was reported on the committee’s website on March 5. “The only item on the agenda is the federal government’s report on the publication of a wiretap of a telephone conversation between high-ranking officers about the Taurus cruise missile,” the message says. The meeting will be chaired by the head of the committee, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann. They drove a split: Germany is divided on the issue of sending the Taurus to Kyiv How the leak scandal will affect the image of the German authorities RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published on March 1 a full transcript of the discussion by high-ranking German officers of possible attacks on the Crimean Bridge with Taurus missiles. This conversation also included a discussion about the supply of these missiles to Ukraine. In a fragment of an audio recording from representatives of the German Air Force, officers discussed how many of these shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether such a strike would be effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on March 2 that the German authorities are engaged in investigation into the leak of a recording of a conversation between German officers, and called this situation a very serious problem. Bild reported then that Graefe was to blame for the incident because he connected to the conversation from Singapore through an unsecured network, creating a threat to the security of the conversation. The Ukrainian side is attempting to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 of the year. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, since, according to him, this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"17 December 2023","The Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) spent too many resources on a counter-offensive that did not bring results, Ukrainian war correspondent Andrey Tsaplienko said in a video posted on December 15 on the NTA YouTube channel. “We really spent a lot of resources on our counter-offensive, which, to Unfortunately, it was not as successful as we expected. We have serious losses, we must admit, we did not even reach Tokmak in the south, having spent a lot of resources. That is, we are quite exhausted - this is the first moment,” said Tsaplienko. In addition, the Ukrainian army lacks human resources. In particular, the military personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces located on the line of combat contact are greatly exhausted, the military correspondent noted. “The third point, we need more Western help, more, many times more. <…> We were given equipment for three tank battalions, and in order to effectively attack, I’m talking about tanks, we needed not three battalions, but at least several brigades,” said the Ukrainian journalist.

Earlier, on December 15, CNN, citing estimates from Western intelligence services, reported that Ukraine could suffer defeat in the conflict with Russia by the summer of 2024 if it loses support USA and its allies. The TV channel also noted that while the Armed Forces of Ukraine are forced to conserve ammunition, Russian troops are “returning fire with an intensity five to seven times greater than what Ukrainian forces are capable of.” On December 14, the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of Russia, Sergei Naryshkin, stated that that the counter-offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) turned out to be a complete failure. The Kiev regime did not achieve any success on the battlefield, but at the same time suffered sensitive, partly irreparable losses in manpower and military equipment, the head of the SVR clarified. On the same day, former NATO commander-in-chief James Stavridis pointed out that the US government was disappointed in Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky due to the failed counter-offensive operation. On the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin, during the “Results of the Year”, said that since the beginning of the Ukrainian counter-offensive Russia destroyed 747 tanks and 2.3 thousand armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces of various classes.

He noted that Ukrainians know about the advantage of the Russian army, and at the same time their armed forces are in a terrible state. “We are pushing them to launch this ‘massive’ spring offensive, but […] they don’t have the resources to turn the tide now,” McGregor said. He advised the Ukrainian army to retreat before it becomes It’s too late, writes Gazeta.Ru. Inglorious attempts: Ukrainian counterattacks in Artemovsk failed.

However, he believes that the West will not stop there. A month earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia's victory in the conflict in Ukraine was inevitable. According to him, this is possible thanks to the unity and cohesion of the Russian people, the courage and heroism of the fighters and the work of the military-industrial complex.

"June 2023","Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) is still drawing water for cooling from the Kakhovka reservoir, but the overall situation remains potentially dangerous. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, stated this on June 8. “ZNPP continues to draw water for cooling from the Kakhovka reservoir, despite the fact that the water level has reached a point at which, according to preliminary calculations, the pumps could no longer work,” Grossi said in a statement. It is noted that the water level in the reservoir is falling at a rate of 4–7 cm per hour. At 18:00 (coinciding with Moscow time) the water level dropped to 12.7 m. Previously, it was assumed that at this level, water intake would be impossible. According to new estimates, the Zaporizhia NPP will be able to continue drawing water if the level drops to 11 m or lower. “However, the overall nuclear safety and security situation remains very fragile and potentially dangerous,” Grossi said. The sabotage of what happened: what will be the consequences of the breach of the Kakhovskaya HPP dam? A state of emergency has been declared in the region, but nothing threatens the water supply of Crimea. Earlier that day, Advisor to the General Director of the Rosenergoatom Concern, Renat Karchaa, said that the destruction of the Kakhovskaya HPP does not pose a direct threat to the Zaporizhia NPP. First Deputy Head of the Administration Russian President Sergei Kiriyenko visited the Zaporizhia NPP, held a meeting with plant specialists and inspected the hydraulic structures. The level in the cooling pond of the Zaporizhzhya NPP has not changed and is 16.67 m. There is no threat to the safety of the station. The dam of the Kakhovskaya HPP broke out on the night of June 6, which led to an uncontrolled release of water. As a result, dozens of settlements, including Kherson and Novaya Kakhovka, were almost completely flooded. The station practically went under water. The Aleshkovsky and Skadovsky districts also fell into the flooding zone. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said that there is no immediate risk to the safety of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant against the backdrop of the situation with the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. According to him, if the water level in the station's cooling reservoir drops below 12.7 m, it will not be possible to continue pumping it. Against the backdrop of the emergency at the Kakhovskaya HPP, the IAEA is increasing the number of inspectors at the Zaporizhzhya NPP. Grossi himself will lead the rotation of mission inspectors. Grossi also said that the situation around the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station remains serious, but there is no reason to panic now. He pointed out that the destruction of the plant in the future could negatively affect the Zaporizhzhya NPP, depriving it of cooling sources and causing damage to the reactors. As reported by the IAEA, the Zaporizhia NPP continues to replenish the water reserves necessary for cooling the reactors using the Kakhovka reservoir. According to the agency's estimates, supplies of water for cooling will not run out for at least a month. In turn, Karchaa said on June 6 that speculation about a threat to the safety of the Zaporizhia NPP is a manifestation of unprofessionalism or a provocation. According to him, the station is equipped with independent cooling systems. On June 7, the head of Rosatom, Alexei Likhachev, said in a conversation with Izvestia that the breakthrough of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric station does not affect the safety of the Zaporizhia NPP. Alternate options for water supply to the station through underground wells and through the beds of small rivers are ready.

"May 18 2023","Expert member of the Royal Society of Canada Pierre Levy explained the reasons for the conflict in Ukraine in an interview with the independent publication Eureporter on May 17. Levy criticized the policies of Western countries for their participation in the conflict. He expressed confidence that the supply of weapons to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) can not only prolong military operations, but also expand their geography. Levy also stated that residents of Western countries are also indirectly involved in Russia's SVO in Ukraine. “In fact, the Russians started [SVO] for a reason. Since 2014, they have been extremely concerned about the future of their country, which the West has looked down on. So we need to look at this in perspective, it’s not just [SVO], which began in February 2022,” the analyst is sure. Pierre Levy is also concerned about the supply of weapons to the Ukrainian Armed Forces by Western “allies” and the amount of material assistance provided to Ukraine. In his opinion, in this way the West is only adding fuel to the fire and prolonging the conflict, and also risks expanding its geography. He believes that with this help, in particular, French and European leaders are putting themselves in the position of a participant in hostilities. The expert believes that in the coming years Europe will spend more money on military expenses, and in fact it is now returning to a war economy. Pierre Levy predicts that the NWO “project” in Ukraine will be extended for years, given that a number of countries are directly benefiting from this. In conclusion, the expert expressed the opinion that the situation must be resolved so that Russia does not feel threatened by Western countries and NATO. “She feels threatened. Let us still remember that Ukraine is not a “country in the stratosphere.” Ukraine was a republic within the USSR, essentially Russian-speaking, with which the Russian Federation has been linked for centuries by historical, cultural, linguistic, and family ties. And already several years ago you knew very well that the population of Ukraine was not en masse in favor of joining NATO,” Levi summed up. Guarantee of irresponsibility: Warsaw promised Kyiv new fighters How the next arms deliveries will affect the course of the North Military District and what else Zelensky agreed on during his visit to Poland On this day, the Financial Times also reported that Ukraine’s allies fear that Kyiv’s military support will soon reach its limit. Officials are increasingly concerned about the flow of aid next year as the US enters a divisive presidential campaign, but the US believes Kyiv has a chance to turn the tide on the conflict in Ukraine in the next five months, reporters here reported. same publications. Several officials in the administration of US President Joe Biden believe that this situation provides Kyiv with an opportunity to begin negotiations. Journalists emphasize that European and Ukrainian officials confirm the US opinion that Ukraine is unlikely to achieve all political goals this year within the framework of the Russian special operation. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, about which the authorities Russia was declared on February 24, 2022 as a result of the worsening situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"16 July 2023","NATO intends to arrange for Ukraine to lose in the conflict with Russia; words about Kyiv’s victory are an illusion. This opinion was shared by journalists from the Italian newspaper IL Fatto Quotidiano (FQ) on July 16. They came to the conclusion that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky understands that he is doomed to defeat. “The noose of democratization is tightening around his neck, because Ukraine is not a democratic country, and it is tolerated only as long as the conflict lasts,” the publication says. In addition, the article states that a long battle with Russian troops will sooner or later exhaust Ukraine: the morale of the army will fall, and there will be fewer and fewer soldiers left. At the same time, the version in which Ukraine would join NATO is no less sad, since the deployment of military bases on the territory of the state will lead to an endless conflict throughout Europe. Extra personnel: the Russian Armed Forces attacked enemy rear targets. Significant losses did not allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to regroup in time and continue attacks. A day earlier, US Army Colonel Douglas McGregor said that Zelensky was trying to hide that the Ukrainian Armed Forces lost 26 thousand people during the counteroffensive. McGregor noted that, in his opinion, Zelensky can currently only be saved from the current situation by the participation of a third party in the conflict. Prior to this, on July 13, American journalist Seymour Hersh called a sign of the failures of the Ukrainian army in the counteroffensive the lack of materials about him on the front pages of Western publications. In addition, Hersh added that the Ukrainian counteroffensive for both Kyiv and Washington would have a number of negative consequences. In particular, this will hit the administration of US President Joe Biden and NATO countries the hardest. At the same time, American political scientist John Mearsheimer said that Ukraine would lose the conflict and lose half of its territories.

"16 October 2023","Russia's launch of a special military operation is not the beginning of a conflict, it is an attempt to end it. Moscow has never objected to doing this through peaceful means, but this is hampered by Kyiv’s position. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated this on October 16 in an interview with the China Media Corporation, the text was published on the Kremlin website. Thus, the Russian leader first recalled the preconditions for the crisis in Ukraine created by the United States in 2008. Then Washington announced that it was waiting for Kyiv to join NATO. Putin wondered why this was done. The situation escalated year after year until it led to the crisis of 2014, and then the escalation reached a new level. “So the start of a special military operation is not the beginning of a war, it is an attempt to stop it. As for ending this conflict by peaceful means, we have never objected to this. Moreover, we even agreed in Istanbul at one time that we are ready for this while ensuring Russia’s legitimate interests in the security sphere. And so the Ukrainian side drew such a very strict framework for itself. We practically agreed with this, but as soon as our troops retreated from the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, the Ukrainian side immediately threw these agreements into the oven,” Putin recalled. After this, he continued, Kyiv decided that it would seek Moscow’s defeat on the battlefield . However, as Putin noted, since the start of his counteroffensive - June 4 - he has suffered only heavy losses without achieving any results. “We know the proposal of our Chinese friends, we highly appreciate it. I believe that they are quite realistic and could be used as the basis for peace agreements. But, unfortunately, the other side does not want to conduct any negotiations. How to negotiate with them if they don’t want to?” - Putin emphasized. Earlier, on October 5, the Russian leader said that the special operation was launched in order to end the war in Ukraine, which began back in 2014 and is already in its tenth year. Vostok News: in the G20 statement they wanted to reflect not only the Ukrainian issue. A number of participating countries pointed out the absence of other conflicts in the declaration, including between Israel and Palestine. He recalled that it was not Russia that intimidated the Crimeans and Sevastopol residents with ethnic cleansing and that it was not Russia that tried to force the Donbass to obedience through shelling and bombing. Back in June, Putin also indicated that Russia was forced to use the army in an attempt to stop the war started by the Kyiv regime in 2014. He added that, with the support of Western partners, the Kiev regime used aviation, tanks, and artillery in the north-west against Donbass. The last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul on March 29, 2022. They lasted about three hours. Later, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow. On October 4 of that year, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky put into effect the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of the country on the impossibility of holding negotiations. The special operation to protect the region, the beginning of which Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of a worsening situation in the Donbass due to increased shelling by Ukrainian troops.

This was stated on Thursday, April 13, by Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev in Nalchik during a meeting on security issues in the North Caucasus. According to him, after the coup in Ukraine in 2014, the United States and its allies did everything to “manifest neo-Nazi, terrorist state in the center of Europe."" The Secretary of the Russian Security Council added that the West has turned the republic into a springboard for confrontation with Russia. “Therefore, we have no other way but to free Ukraine from neo-Nazism. Only Russia’s victory will ensure the security of our country, will contribute to the return of stability in Europe and the establishment of a multipolar world,” Patrushev said. “The ideology of Nazism once again creates threats to the security of our country” Putin explained how the Russian Federation can respond to the actions of the West and what the main task of the Russians is now. Earlier, on March 16, official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that Ukrainian neo-Nazis and their Western patrons will inevitably be overtaken a fair verdict, this is the course of history. On March 6, Italian researcher Alessandro Orsini compared the West with Germany during the Nazi era. The analyst noted that the Nazi essence of Western countries led by the United States never disappeared and surfaced “in all its inhumanity, using Ukrainians as cannon fodder.” He emphasized that Italy was drawn into the conflict and was sending weapons to Kyiv only to “please the White House.” Prior to this, on February 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that nationalism in Ukraine had been fueled by the West for a long time, back in the 19th century. As the head of state added, after World War II, those who collaborated with Adolf Hitler and the Nazis left Ukraine and went to Europe, most often to the USA and Canada. Since February 24, Russia has been conducting a special operation to protect Donbass, whose residents refused to recognize the results of the coup d'etat 2014 in Ukraine.

The Messenger reported this on December 7. “The Messenger has learned that a series of meetings over the past month between U.S. officials and representatives of the Ukrainian Presidential Office and the [Ukrainian] Ministry of Defense concluded that the months-long counteroffensive against Russian troops did not achieve its goals and reached a dead end,” the publication said. The publication emphasized that the interlocutors acknowledged the lack of achievements on the key goals of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and also noted that the likelihood of achieving them is low, “especially if American assistance is suspended.” As The Messenger points out, at one of the meetings, “American participants went so far as to propose revising long-standing US policy,” which implied that the Kyiv authorities would independently determine the conditions for victory in the conflict. At the same time, the publication continued, one of the officials of the United States administration told The Messenger that Washington will continue to adhere to the policy according to which “Ukraine itself will decide how to define victory” and how to end the Ukrainian conflict. In addition, the meeting also raised the issue of deteriorating relations between Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and a number of Ukrainian generals, including the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Valeriy Zaluzhny, as well as the impact these relations will have on the course of the conflict. “They are suffering colossal losses in manpower” How Russian artillerymen from the 132nd brigade destroy the enemy attacking Gorlovka On the same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are forced to switch to strategic defense in attempts to resist the advance of Russian troops. In addition, the material clarifies that the failures of the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian army force Western countries to cast great doubt on the provision of new assistance to Kyiv. Earlier, on December 7, The Washington Post newspaper reported that Ukraine would be forced to agree to the “Korean scenario” for exiting the conflict if NATO will not increase its support. As the article pointed out, without the alliance's help, ""Ukraine will fight with insufficient strength,"" and may ultimately have to agree to a partition similar to that carried out in Korea. If the American weapons pipeline is blocked, making another major offensive impossible, a tired and increasingly restless Ukraine will have no choice but to explore the possibility of a settlement. On the same day, scientists at Germany's leading classical university and think tank, Kiel University, calculated that that the volume of military, financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine from Western states from August to October fell by almost 90% compared to the same period in 2022. Over the past three months, of the 42 states offering assistance to Kyiv, only 20 have committed to providing new aid packages, they said. Prior to this, on December 1, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky admitted that “voices are heard” in the West in favor of negotiations with Russia, although he personally does not feel forced by his partners to engage in dialogue with Moscow. The day before, Zelensky complained that Ukraine “fell out of the focus of attention of the world community.” On November 1, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny, said in an interview that Ukrainian troops could not achieve a breakthrough, since the conflict had reached a dead end. Prolongation of hostilities carries great risks for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling from the Ukrainian military. However, recently in the West there have been increasingly frequent statements about the need to reduce support for Ukraine.

"August 2023","Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu called the decision of the United States of America to include cluster munitions in the aid package to Ukraine a war crime. He made this statement on Wednesday, August 9, at a meeting of the board of the Russian defense ministry. “In the context of a growing shortage of ammunition for Western-style artillery systems in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Washington committed a war crime by including cluster munitions prohibited by the international convention in the aid package,” the minister said. According to him, the United States is “steadily raising the stakes” by seeking from allies deliveries of increasingly long-range and deadly weapons. Shoigu recalled that in May, long-range Storm Shadow aircraft guided missiles were delivered to Kyiv, and currently the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance are actively considering the issue of transferring F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. The use of weapons such as cluster munitions is prohibited by the convention, which has entered into came into force on August 1, 2010, it was signed by 123 countries, but ratified by only 110. The convention was not signed by Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Latvia, Poland, Russia, Romania, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine, Finland and Estonia. On August 7, the acting head of the Donetsk People's Republic Denis Pushilin reported an increase in the number of civilian casualties as the Kyiv regime used cluster munitions. The United States approved the shipment of cluster munitions as aid to the Ukrainian Armed Forces on July 7. US President Joe Biden called the supply of these shells a temporary step aimed at supporting Ukraine until it is possible to increase the production of artillery shells. On July 13, the Pentagon confirmed the transfer of cluster munitions to Kyiv. The Federation Council appealed to the world's parliaments and international organizations with a request to condemn the United States for supplying cluster munitions to Ukraine.

"17 November 2023","Ukrainian officials are plundering the state budget, waiting for the end of the conflict. Ukrainian politician, ex-head of the Lugansk Regional Military Administration Sergei Gaidai stated this on November 16 in an interview with the Politeka Online YouTube channel. “They are increasing their content in the new state budget. The country’s population has decreased significantly, but government officials have not been laid off, and salaries are increasing,” he noted. According to Gaidai, the authorities decided that for them the conflict in Ukraine had already ended. Therefore, civil servants hold weddings for millions of dollars, buy expensive foreign cars and “vegetate in restaurants in Kyiv.” TV series and drums: why corruption scandals do not subside in Ukraine The Minister of Culture spoke about a “wave of misunderstanding” and resigned. Earlier, on November 10, German Member of the European Parliament (EP) Gunnar Beck noted that the EU had decided to increase funding for Kyiv by €50 billion, despite the “rapid growth in the level of corruption and the deterioration of the situation with the rule of law in Ukraine.” Prior to this, on November 3, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that nowhere in the world there is such corruption as in Ukraine. The Russian leader pointed out that corruption in Ukraine is practically legalized. The West will not be able to fight it, he believes. Earlier, on October 31, former Pentagon adviser, retired colonel Douglas McGregor, said that the only events currently happening inside Ukraine are corruption and crime. According to him, few in the West are now ready to admit this, although the situation is changing. On October 14, ZN.ua editor-in-chief Yulia Mostovaya, during the National Media Talk 2023 conference held in Kyiv, said that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky demanded that Ukrainian journalists not cover facts corruption in the country, if they become aware of it. She noted that the Ukrainian leader made his request against the backdrop of an investigation into inflated prices for products for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov noted on October 11 that Ukraine is an “oasis of corruption,” and its president is currently in a rather difficult situation and is beginning to bother Europe and the United States. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

This was stated on March 6 by the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov during the educational marathon “Knowledge. The first” as part of the World Youth Festival. “And if American planes fly there, I have no doubt, our military will also make sure that these planes burn and fall,” said the Kremlin representative. He emphasized that American tanks are driving through Russian territory. “It’s bad, but they drive until a certain point, and then they burn. We will continue to destroy them,” added the Kremlin representative, notes Gazeta.Ru. According to him, the West is playing with fire, discussing the need to send its soldiers to Ukraine. Discussions of this kind risk leading to “degradation of the situation,” Peskov concluded. Prior to this, on March 4, Peskov said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was being reported on all the successes of the Russian military on the front line, including the destruction of American Abrams tanks. A day earlier, a representative of the manufacturer of the Upyr drone told Izvestia that the Russian military destroyed another American Abrams tank in the Avdeevka direction.

"August 2023","Ukrainian troops are preparing to move on to the third and final stage of the counteroffensive. This was reported by the British newspaper Express on Saturday, August 5, citing Ukrainian military personnel and a source in American intelligence. The publication's article states that the offensive of the Ukrainian army will reach its climax when it brings into battle heavy mechanized brigades trained by Western countries. “Now Ukraine can move on to the third stage of the counteroffensive,” the newspaper notes. The publication also claims that during the two months of the Ukrainian offensive, troops suffered heavy losses due to the Russian defense line. This forced the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) to change tactics in order to attract the remaining equipment for the final stage of their counteroffensive. Repelled forces: in two months, the VFU lost more than 43 thousand people. The Russian army destroyed most of the group prepared for the Ukrainian “counteroffensive.” Meanwhile, ex-US Marine Brian Berletic said that Ukrainian troops will not be able to hold the territories occupied during the counteroffensive. He noted that Russian defense lines are specifically designed to trap and destroy NATO-trained Ukrainian combat units. According to Berletik, the Ukrainian Armed Forces cannot even reach the first line. Moreover, on August 6, former US Army intelligence officer Scott Ritter reported that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky is carrying out the order of the North Atlantic Alliance to switch to assault tactics with a large number of armored vehicles, which are destroyed on the battlefield by the Russian army . In his opinion, NATO is disappointed in the Ukrainian counter-offensive due to the lack of significant successes. At the end of July, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the failure of Kyiv’s offensive. The head of state pointed out that during the clashes, Russian forces destroyed a record amount of Western equipment. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu also said that the losses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in July amounted to more than 20 thousand military personnel.

"November 30 2023","Official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova was surprised by the statement of German Foreign Minister Annalena Bärbock about her Russian colleague. A year ago, the head of the German Foreign Ministry was not interested in the situation in which the Polish chairmanship did not send Russia an invitation to the OSCE Ministerial Council meeting, the diplomat said on November 30. “For some reason, a year ago, she was not concerned that Sergei Lavrov did not appear in the hall at all, since the Polish chairmanship did not sent Russia an invitation to the meeting,” she wrote in her Telegram channel, commenting on Berbock’s words that the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry “appears in the hall only when he himself speaks, and not to listen to others.” Zakharova also joked , that if the head of the German Foreign Ministry had said earlier that “she longs to admire Lavrov in the hall,” then NATO countries would not have interfered with the arrival of the Russian delegation at international forums. She added that all speeches at the Council of Ministers are broadcast online and listen to them is possible from anywhere on the planet, and the opportunity to speak is given only to those who are in the hall. “The OSCE will not be able to resolve the crisis in Ukraine” Russian Permanent Representative to the organization Alexander Lukashevich - about the oppression of Russians in the Baltics, attacks by Ukraine and the future of the association Earlier on Thursday, Zakharova said that Lavrov’s speech at the OSCE Ministerial Council meeting will also touch upon the security crisis in Europe caused by the reluctance of the United States to build a normal order of relations. The two-day format of the OSCE Ministerial Council, held November 30 - December 1 in Skopje (North Macedonia), includes plenary sessions and other events within the council and on its sidelines.

"July 29 2023","The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are suffering heavy losses due to Russian mines. This was stated by current German Brigadier General Christian Freuding on July 29. “Sometimes demining specialists have to crawl through minefields on their stomachs and neutralize one mine after another, performing life-threatening work manually,” the military portal T-online reports the words. Freuding noted that sappers are often fired upon. According to the US State Department, the mined area in Ukraine is equal to approximately half the area of the entire Germany. According to Freding, due to the mine clearance process, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are moving through this territory with heavy losses, and the movement itself has become almost impossible for them. At the same time, it has become almost impossible to comply with the NATO principle for handling mines - dodging or bypassing them. “All attempts at a counteroffensive have been stopped” Vladimir Putin called the losses of the Ukrainian army Earlier, on July 29, a serviceman with the call sign Buka from the 2nd Infantry Battalion named after Dmitry Donskoy said that an attempt to attack by Ukrainian Armed Forces infantrymen in the Ugledar direction in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) failed because that they were blown up by their own mines. He noted that Ukrainian troops are trying to attack Russian positions, but to no avail. On July 27, Newsweek, citing Western experts, reported that NATO countries were responsible for the failure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ counteroffensive. The magazine writes that the alliance moved up the timing of the offensive and for this reason did not have time to prepare the Ukrainian military.

"23 July 2023","The United States still does not intend to supply ATACMS operational-tactical missile systems to Ukraine. The Washington Post reported this on July 22, citing sources in the Pentagon. It is noted that the administration of US President Joe Biden “still firmly adheres” to its position and does not plan to transfer long-range missiles to Ukraine. At the same time, pressure from American legislators and Kiev is growing. According to the newspaper, due to disappointment due to the slow pace of the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) and Biden’s controversial statements, speculation and assumptions have begun about possible deliveries of ATACMS to Ukraine in the near future. However, the publication’s source emphasized that no substantive discussions are being held on this topic, and Washington’s position has not changed. As The Washington Post’s interlocutor pointed out, the Pentagon believes that ATACMS complexes are not on the list of the most pressing needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Member of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs Dmitry Belik said on July 12 in a conversation with Izvestia that the United States is trying to balance between providing another military aid to Ukraine and doing it carefully and calculating the subsequent risks. Therefore, controversy arises on this issue in Washington. Thus, he commented on information from The New York Times that the administration of US President Joe Biden is holding a “quiet debate” about the possible transfer of ATACMS long-range missiles to Ukraine. On June 29, The Wall Street Journal reported the American administration’s readiness to approve deliveries Kyiv ATACMS complexes.

The decision to hold it was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by Ukrainian troops.

"January 1 2024","Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky was angry when he learned about the interview of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Valeriy Zaluzhny to The Economist magazine, where he admitted the unpleasant truth about the situation at the front. The Financial Times wrote about this on January 1. “Until this point, Zaluzhny remained aloof from media attention, with a few exceptions, in particular, a November interview with The Economist magazine, in which he said that the situation had reached a dead end - a taboo word in government circles , which infuriated the president,” the material says. “Bug” of discord: what will the new conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny lead to? The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine accused the president of the failure of mobilization. On November 1, Zaluzhny, in an interview for The Economist magazine, said that Ukrainian troops cannot achieve a breakthrough, since the conflict has reached a dead end. Prolongation of hostilities carries great risks for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he noted. Zelensky on November 4 did not agree with the opinion of the commander in chief. He admitted that the offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is difficult due to the fact that Russian forces control the skies, but “this is not a stalemate.” At the same time, the deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, Igor Zhovkva, noted that Zaluzhny’s statement was inappropriate and caused panic among the leadership of Western countries. On November 28, The Economist reported that the conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny was provoked by the failure of the counteroffensive. The publication also notes that the relationship between the president and the commander-in-chief deteriorated after Zaluzhny’s interview with The Economist in early November, in which the general called the Ukrainian conflict a dead end for Kiev. Later, the Financial Times newspaper, citing a source, wrote that after Zaluzhny’s words about the situation on the front line, some Western the leaders called Kiev to clarify whether negotiations with Russia are now a priority for the Ukrainian side. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"11 September 2023","The Russian Armed Forces (AF) have achieved success in the Kupyansk region of the Kharkov region against the backdrop of the Ukrainian offensive, The New York Times writes on September 11. “It is the Russians who are advancing and forming what the Ukrainian military calls a “shock fist”, with tens of thousands of soldiers near the cities Kupyansk and Kremennaya,” the publication notes, referring to Ukrainian soldiers. According to them, Russian units are achieving “small tactical successes” in this area. In this regard, as the newspaper notes, the actions of Russian forces forced Kyiv to send a number of the most experienced air assault units to the area in the summer. The city is waiting: Russian units are approaching Kupyansk Problems with reserves do not allow the enemy to stabilize the situation, experts believe. Earlier, on September 9, Russian artillery forces repelled three attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) in the Kupyansk direction. A few days before, on September 7, Lieutenant Colonel Retired Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) Andrei Marochko said that the Russian Armed Forces continue to successfully advance in the Kupyansk direction towards the Oskol reservoir and the settlements of Senkovo and Sverdlovka. According to him, the Russian army captured several strongholds of Ukrainian troops within 24 hours. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"12 July 2023","The United States is trying to balance between providing yet another military aid to Ukraine, and doing it carefully and calculating the subsequent risks. Therefore, controversy arises on this issue in Washington. Dmitry Belik, a member of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, told Izvestia about this on July 12. Thus, he commented on information from The New York Times that a “quiet debate” is taking place in the administration of US President Joe Biden about the possible transfer of long-range missiles to Ukraine ATACMS actions. “In general, there is nothing surprising in the fact that the West is able to decide on new supplies. But this only creates more problems for Ukraine, which gets bogged down in an unsuccessful counteroffensive and loses its army. Deliveries of further types of weapons are the next steps towards the escalation of the conflict, in the crucible of which a large number of those whom the Kiev regime is thoughtlessly driving to slaughter are dying,” Belik said. The parliamentarian added that Russia will need to respond appropriately to these supplies, increasing and strengthening its military power. Hands untied: what response will the Russian Federation give to the supply of cluster munitions to Kyiv? Sergei Shoigu stated Russia’s superiority in the effectiveness and diversity of this type of weapons. On June 29, The Wall Street Journal newspaper reported the American administration’s readiness to approve the supply of ATACMS systems to Kyiv. According to the publication, the issue of supplies is in the process of being agreed upon at the highest level. The initiative to provide Kyiv with ATACMS missile systems was presented on June 9 by a group of American congressmen, announcing the introduction of a resolution of the House of Representatives from both parties. In it, they called on the US presidential administration to provide Ukraine with ATACMS as soon as possible in order to achieve “significant successes on the battlefield.” Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which has been ongoing since February 24, 2022. The corresponding decision was made in connection with the aggravation of the situation in the region due to attacks by the Ukrainian military.

"March 2024","The European Union (EU) does not yet need to create a unified army, but instead needs to work on cohesion between the military forces of each member country. This was stated by the alliance's High Representative for Foreign Policy and Security, Josep Borrell, as quoted by the Politico newspaper on March 6. “Defense is the competence of member states. The point is not to have an EU army, but to work better together with the 27 armies,” he said. At the same time, Borrell clarified that among the EU countries there was a “sense of urgency and responsibility” to intensify joint work in the field of defense In addition, the newspaper pointed out that for many years Germany, France and Hungary have called on other EU countries to create a unified army, but in recent months this topic has died down amid intense discussions on defense issues. The publication noted that, according to the German MEP Hannah Neumann, the reason for the abandonment of such ideas is the inability of the organization to produce the necessary amount of ammunition to protect the alliance and its allies. Get a spin: The West has turned Ukraine into a weapons testing site How the United States and European countries are making money by prolonging the conflict and the deaths of civilians On the eve of March 5, Borrell said that the EU defense industry does not have enough funding to produce enough weapons to help Ukraine and European needs countries According to him, it is necessary to meet demand. That day, the European Commission (EC) presented the EU defense industry strategy. It included purchasing at least 40% of defense equipment on a joint basis by 2030, increasing the share of trade in this area within the European Union to 35% of the value of the alliance's circulating market also by 2030, and ensuring at least 50% of defense purchases within the organization . The strategy also proposes to include Ukraine in it. As indicated, this implies the development of close ties with Kiev and its full participation in EU initiatives in support of the defense industry. In mid-February, the EU defense industry strategy was announced by EC head Ursula von der Leyen at the Munich Security Conference. She noted that this provides for an increase in military production by 20%. The head of the EC also added that Europeans must “outwit” Russia on the battlefield. Because of the conflict in Ukraine, European countries began to announce plans to increase the pace of their defense industry. Thus, on February 14, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Germany would increase its capacity for the production of artillery shells. He added that Germany will transfer three to four times more artillery shells to Ukraine than in 2023. In addition, on February 13, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called on NATO countries to increase their defense capabilities. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine by against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"26 June 2023","At least 17 Bradley infantry vehicles that the US sent to Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed, more than 15% of the number promised. The New York Times (NYT) reported this on June 26, citing a senior American official. In March, the United States promised 113 Bradley fighting vehicles, the newspaper noted. “Three weeks after the launch of a counteroffensive critical to Ukraine’s prospects against Russia, its The army faces a number of annoying problems that complicate its plans, even though it has modern Western weapons,” the material says. Assessment of success: the Russian army repulsed all enemy attacks within a week. The VFU were unable to break through our defenses, losing at least two brigades, experts note Columnist Phillips Payson O'Brien, in an article for The Atlantic, said on June 24 that Western military equipment does not save the Armed Forces forces of Ukraine (AFU) from defeat due to the effectiveness of Russian weapons. He wrote that the Russian side has more air forces. The author also drew attention to the fact that in terms of technological characteristics, Russian aircraft are superior to Ukrainian ones. The next day, photographs of a destroyed Ukrainian Armed Forces convoy with Western equipment in the Orekhovsk direction in the Zaporozhye region were published on the Internet. The photo shows Leopard tanks, Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, as well as other Western equipment. As InfoBRICS wrote on June 14, Ukraine lost a significant part of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicles due to the fact that the West underestimated the capabilities of the Russian army. Of the nine vehicles, six were destroyed in the battles near Orekhovo, three were damaged but could be repaired, Gazeta.Ru noted. At that time, the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was in an active phase, while Kyiv did not achieve almost any noticeable results. A day earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a meeting with military officers in the Kremlin, said that a large-scale Ukrainian counteroffensive using reserves began on June 4 and continues to this day . The head of state pointed out the lack of any successes of the Ukrainian army, and the losses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in personnel are approaching catastrophic. Meanwhile, Putin drew attention to the fact that Leopard tanks, like Bradley vehicles, burn well. According to him, the Russian Armed Forces destroyed 25–30% of Ukraine’s equipment. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which has been carried out since February 24, 2022.

"June 8 2023","There is a targeted disinformation campaign in the American media surrounding the situation with the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station. This was stated on Thursday, June 8, by the Russian Ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, commenting on the reaction of the United States of America to the breach of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station dam. “Many insinuations have appeared on the topic that Russia itself allegedly undermined the most important infrastructure facility. Representatives of the administration built their rhetoric as if the Russian Federation in any case bears responsibility for all incidents occurring during the Ukrainian conflict,” the diplomat said. According to Antonov, this presentation of information does not stand up to criticism. He called the approach of the American media an attempt to “whitewash” the Kiev regime, which, in turn, had been shelling the hydraulic structure for many months. The diplomat believes that Ukraine’s terrorist actions will receive further support from the United States. The sabotage of what happened: what will be the consequences of the breach of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station dam? A state of emergency has been declared in the region, but nothing threatens the water supply of Crimea. Earlier this day, the head of the Russian Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights (HRC) Valery Fadeev called the West's reaction to the destruction of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric station cynical lies. As he said, reports that the Russians themselves destroyed the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station are insane. Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova said that the reaction of Western countries in this situation is predictable, since countries are driven by the desire to blame Moscow for everything that happens, “outside depending on whether it actually happened or is a figment of the imagination.” The diplomat also added that the situation with the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station should become the object of worldwide study and investigation. Russia's permanent representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya a day earlier indicated the Russian side's interest in investigating the breakthrough of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station; Russia plans to raise this issue at a meeting of the Security Council of the international organization. The US administration did not began to name those responsible for blowing up the hydroelectric power station and referred to the collection of data related to what happened. American President Joe Biden, when asked to comment on the situation, responded with a promise to provide assistance to Ukraine. The Kakhovka hydroelectric power station dam broke on the night of June 6, causing an uncontrolled release of water. As a result, dozens of settlements found themselves in the flood zone. In Novaya Kakhovka in the Kherson region, the water level reached 12 m. The station itself almost completely went under water. The destruction of the hydroelectric power station caused serious damage to the environment. Agricultural fields along the Dnieper were washed away, and there is also a risk of shallowing of the North Crimean Canal. According to available information, the shelling was carried out by the Ukrainian side from the Vilkha MLRS. The Investigative Committee (IC) of Russia opened a criminal case under the article “Terrorism.” Kakhovskaya HPP is the sixth and lowest station on the Dnieper and is part of the unified energy system of Ukraine. It is located five kilometers from the city of Novaya Kakhovka, Kherson region, which on September 30, 2022 became part of Russia following a referendum. The waters of the Kakhovka reservoir feed the arid areas of the Kherson region and the Crimean peninsula.

"July 2023","Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev called Ukraine's desire to reach the 1991 borders divorced from reality. He published a message on this topic on Sunday, July 2, in his Telegram channel. “<...> These are the borders of the regions of Russia and once the provinces of the Russian Empire, and not the mythical Ukraine. Ukraine is the Land of Sannikov, founded by Lenin. It didn't last long and disappeared from the map. There is no such land. Whatever they think in the West and in the occupied Russian city of Kyiv,” the politician wrote. In addition, Medvedev supplemented the message with a fragment from the film “Sannikov’s Land,” filmed in the early 1970s based on the novel of the same name by Vladimir Obruchev. The excerpt repeats the phrase from the politician’s text “No, there is no land there.” Sannikov Land is a ghost island located north of the New Siberian Islands in the Arctic Ocean. Expeditions were sent to this area more than once, but no land was discovered there. Earlier, on July 1, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said that Kyiv would be ready for a peaceful dialogue with Russia when the Ukrainian armed forces reached the 1991 borders. He called the border of February 24, 2022 a contact line, and therefore access to it will not lead to the start of negotiations. The dense EU: how the summit of leaders of the association countries started How European politicians plan to help Kyiv and what is the likelihood of sending a military mission to Ukraine On the same day, Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council Konstantin Kosachev, commenting on this statement, emphasized that it has no prospects. Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Vladimir Dzhabarov agreed with him. On June 9, in a conversation with Izvestia, he said that for Russia, talk about the 1991 borders is absolutely unacceptable, because Crimea and all four new regions, according to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, are Russian lands. In turn, Federation Council Senator Sergei Tsekov on May 23 noted that if peace was important to Zelensky, he would agree to negotiations with Moscow without preconditions, but if the Ukrainian leader takes such a step, he will lose Western support. A special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin February 24, ongoing.

"March 2023","The West is going to resolve the situation in Ukraine through negotiations, while the United States and its allies do not rule out the possibility of dividing the country into two parts. National Review columnist Noah Rothman writes about this. According to the columnist, the West's enthusiasm for resolving the Ukrainian issue has already begun to decline and will continue to decline. As a result, the Ukrainian authorities will be faced with a fait accompli - they will be offered a scenario for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. It is noted that under this scenario, Ukraine will literally be divided into two parts “with the approval of its so-called supporters.” One for all: Russia accepted the new territories of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions became part of the Russian Federation. Rotman also added that by that time the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will be too exhausted and weak, and therefore will not be able to resist Russian troops. Because of this, they will not be able to reach the borders of Ukraine in 1991. In addition, the journalist calculated that the United States and the European Union will have to pay too high a price for organizing a counteroffensive in Donbass and seizing Crimea. Such large-scale operations will require a colossal amount of equipment and ammunition. In addition, such battles are unlikely to be possible without air support. In addition, money will also be needed to pay for intelligence data from foreign intelligence services, the observer claims. He also notes that Russia does not intend to leave its new territories, so the scenario of the division of Ukraine following peace negotiations in such a situation looks the most realistic. At the same time, Rothman is confident that France, Germany and the United States are ready to come to terms with the fact that there will be a “destabilized” state in the person of Ukraine on NATO’s borders. It will be more difficult for Poland and the Baltic states to make this decision. Earlier that day, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that decisions on the conditions of peace in Ukraine will remain with the Ukrainians, this also applies to territorial concessions to Kyiv. This is how Scholz answered the question about whether it is possible to negotiate a settlement of the conflict on the terms of Ukraine’s renunciation of claims in the territory of Donbass and Crimea. Earlier, in October 2022, former US Ambassador to the USSR Jack Matlock said that Ukraine should renounce claims to territories annexed to the Russian Federation and agree to negotiations. He expressed the opinion that even with NATO support, Ukraine will not be able to create a stable, functioning state within the 1991 borders. Attempts to return the territories by force will lead to further escalation of the conflict. On September 30, following the results of the referendums, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed agreements on the inclusion of the DPR and LPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions into the Russian Federation. Crimea became part of the Russian Federation in 2014 following a referendum.

"20 September 2023","On September 20, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, agreed with the statement of Polish President Andrzej Duda, who compared Ukraine to a drowning man, but clarified that Warsaw itself also helped push it “to the depths.” “Never have I agreed so much with Duda.” , as after this statement. Everything is just like that. A small but very important clarification is missing. Official Warsaw, which regularly participated in regime changes in this country, helped push Ukraine into the depths,” Zakharova noted in her Telegram channel. At the same time, she stated that NATO and the Polish authorities “are tying what heavier"": drones, shells and tanks. Noting that in the presence of such “saviors,” a drowning state will face an unimportant outcome, Gazeta.Ru adds. “With such “rescuers,” the drowning state’s case is rubbish. But the rules of the game had to be clarified on shore,” the diplomat concluded. The military-industrial complex rules the roost there: Poland enters into huge contracts for the purchase of weapons Militarist frenzy is growing in the country Earlier on September 20, Duda, speaking at the UN General Assembly, compared Ukraine to a drowning person who is “extremely dangerous because he can pull you into the depths and simply drown the rescuer "" Duda warned that if Ukraine files a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) in connection with Poland’s extension of restrictions on the supply of Ukrainian grain, then Poland will explain the situation before the tribunal. At the same time, Polish journalist and publicist Łukasz Warzecha noted in his account on the social network X that Poland It has put itself in the position of a donor for Ukraine, so the realism that recently appeared in relations between Warsaw and Kyiv does not matter. The author was referring to the refusal to lift the ban on the import of Ukrainian grain to Poland, saying that relations between the states had become tense due to statements by Ukrainian politicians. In turn, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Alexander Grushko noted that a scandal between Poland and Ukraine over grain is unlikely will affect military supplies to Kyiv. Although the current situation actually showed the true attitude of the West towards Ukraine, he added. Earlier, on September 15, the European Commission lifted restrictions on the import of four types of agricultural products from Ukraine. Poland and Slovakia decided to unilaterally extend the import ban. Later, on September 18, Kyiv filed a lawsuit with the WTO against Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, which banned the import of Ukrainian agricultural products.

Politico columnists Eleni Kurea and Esther Webber wrote about this on Thursday, November 30. “Joe Biden’s secret weapon in Ukraine is Liz Truss,” the article says. According to the authors of the material, Truss arrived in Washington to convince Republicans opposed to any funding for Ukraine. “A pitched battle is expected next week with a possible Senate vote on Biden's $106 billion aid package, of which $61.4 billion is earmarked for Ukraine. Senior diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic hope that Truss can help break the impasse,” the publication said. At the same time, according to Politico, the former British prime minister’s delegation does not have a meeting scheduled with former US President Donald Trump, who belongs to the Republican Party. According to conservative lawmaker Jack Lopresti, who arrived in Washington with Truss, the goal of the delegation is to make Republicans who support Trump understand the need to help Ukraine. Austin Chondrosis: The United States and Germany are reconsidering assistance to Ukraine Who might benefit from a truce in 2024 Earlier, on November 29, American political scientist Malek Dudakov expressed the opinion that the US Congress will not be able to agree on the allocation of assistance to Kyiv before the end of the year. The Americanist noted that in the next month and a half, the scale of aid allocated to Kyiv will be greatly reduced. Earlier, serious disagreements arose in the US Congress on the issue of financing Ukraine. A significant number of Republicans advocate stopping spending money on a foreign country when there are a lot of unresolved problems in their own country. Before this, on November 20, Lloyd Austin at a press conference during a visit to Kyiv said that the United States does not have a magic solution that would instantly solve the problems APU. As part of his visit, Austin also announced a new package of military assistance to Ukraine worth $100 million, which included ammunition for artillery and air defense systems and anti-tank weapons, the Zvezda TV channel reported. Prior to this, on November 13, National Security Adviser to the American President Jake Sullivan said that financing the provision of Ukraine with what the United States considers necessary is becoming more difficult every week due to the refusal of the House of Representatives of Congress to allocate additional funds for these purposes, NSN reports. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of Russia’s special operation to protect the Donbass, which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022.

Retired US Lieutenant General Mark Hertling announced this on March 31, noting that the Ukrainian army needs rest. “Ukrainian troops need to recover. It's hard. And Ukrainian soldiers, mostly fresh recruits, will have to advance, rather than sit in the trenches, and with new weapons. This is even more difficult,” the ex-military expressed his opinion on Twitter. As Hertling added, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been fighting for the past year, and in the future they will still have to try to “break through” Russian defenses, as well as try to occupy and hold territories. “Ukrainian troops can occupy additional territory, but the spring counteroffensive will not bring them victory,” the retired lieutenant general concluded. Losses of persons: why the UFU do not retreat from Avdeevka Ukrainian formations are ready to hold on to the territory of the DPR, not paying attention to the number of dead. Earlier that day, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko proposed declaring a truce in Ukraine without the right to move troops and transfer weapons and equipment. In his opinion, Ukrainian military personnel no longer want to conduct military operations, because they do not understand what their meaning is. At the same time, according to him, the “massacre” in Ukraine will not end until the United States gives the go-ahead.

A day earlier, the head of state complained that Ukraine “fell out of the focus of attention of the world community.” Prior to this, on November 24, Bloomberg, citing survey results, stated that the number of Ukrainians who are ready to sacrifice territories for the sake of peace with Russia is growing. The publication notes that over the year the situation on the battlefield for Kyiv has hardly changed and the Ukrainian authorities are disappointed that their allies underestimated the power of Russian defense lines. On November 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia has never abandoned peace negotiations on Ukraine, while Kyiv publicly opposed dialogue with Moscow and Zelensky signed a decree prohibiting such negotiations. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which the Russian Federation announced on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"23 October 2023","In Washington, they fear that Moscow may upset the balance of power in Europe that is favorable to the United States, Symington Smith, a member of the National Committee on US-China Relations, reported on October 22. Smith’s article, published in the National Interest, states that the United States primarily regards assistance to Ukraine as a “strategic maneuver in a geopolitical game.” According to the expert, Washington fears the emergence of a new dominant force in Europe and is trying with all its might to avoid this. The author of the article emphasized that Russia’s significant authority in Eastern European countries “disturbs the balance”, since Moscow could gain access to European energy corridors and trade routes. “This is an alarming prospect for Washington, which seeks to maintain a balanced power dynamic in Europe,” Smith concluded . “We have made a choice in favor of a multipolar world” Deputy Foreign Minister of Venezuela Carlos Ron - about the transition to payments in national currencies, relations between Moscow and Caracas, as well as the internal political situation in the country Earlier, on October 20, during his election event, US President Joe Biden said that humanity needs a new world order, which the United States is capable of building. The American leader noted that he was optimistic, but much would depend on events in the near future. A week earlier, on October 13, Turkish Parliament Speaker Numan Kurtulmuş said that the current international system was in a deplorable state: it could not successfully pass the test of crisis management On October 10, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov noted that the world is experiencing dramatic, tectonic changes. According to him, the world majority advocates a more equitable distribution of global goods and respect for civilizational diversity, but at the same time, a narrow group of Western states led by the United States “seeks to use neocolonial methods to slow down the natural course of things and maintain their elusive dominance.” Earlier, October 5 , Russian President Vladimir Putin said that lasting global peace will only be established when everyone feels safe and knows that their opinions are respected. According to him, if a country is aimed at hegemony, and arbitrariness reigns in the system, then anyone can be under attack. At the same time, the Russian leader said that Russia now faces the task of “building a new world.” Share: if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1593645'); } else { document.addEventListener('recommendationRunInit', function() { if (typeof window.recommendationRun !== 'undefined') { recommendationRun('recommendation-block-1593645'); } }); }",2023-10-23
"February 22 2024","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva that the United States does not see conditions for negotiations on the Ukrainian conflict in the near future. AFP reported this on February 21. “We don’t see the conditions for [diplomacy] right now,” he said. The agency’s interlocutor noted that the Brazilian leader did not entirely agree with the opinion of the Secretary of State. Lula da Silva expressed the hope that to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, as well as to de-escalate the Middle East, it is necessary to use all possible methods of diplomacy. Trial window: the Russian Federation allows negotiations with Kiev in a Western country Which state besides Hungary could become a mediator between Moscow and Kiev On February 9, Russian President Vladimir Putin, during an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson, said that Russia and Ukraine would sooner or later come to an agreement and relations between peoples will be restored. He noted that the West thinks that hostilities will forever “tear apart” one part of the Russian people from another. However, reunification will happen, Putin is sure. On February 18, US Senator from Ohio James David Vance said that peace in Ukraine can be achieved provided that Kyiv makes territorial concessions. As Vance emphasized, the United States does not have the necessary volume of production capacity to continue the conflict in Eastern Europe in the long term. Moreover, on February 15, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin expressed the opinion that Kyiv and Western countries do not show the will to peacefully resolve the conflict in Ukraine. He noted that Russia has never refused to achieve the goals of the North Military District through diplomatic means. The last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place on March 29, 2022 in Istanbul. They lasted about three hours. Later, Kyiv officially abandoned contacts with Moscow. On October 4, 2022, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky enacted the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of the country on the impossibility of holding negotiations with Putin.

"20 October 2023","US military support for Israel, including in the matter of supplying ammunition, could weaken Ukraine. Military expert, senior researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences Vladimir Prokhvatilov said this on Friday, October 20. “The US supply of ammunition to Israel will certainly weaken the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU),” Prokhvatilov said in a conversation with Lenta.Ru. According to the military expert, despite the fact that Israel has its own modern equipment and the state does not require support in such volumes as Ukraine, ammunition is still needed. He added that the United States supplied Israel with missile defense (air defense) systems, which Ukraine will now also not get. “The country could receive them and strengthen its counter-offensive. According to my information, Ukraine will not be able to receive ammunition from other Western countries: depletion is observed everywhere, in addition, supplies are not carried out simultaneously. For some period, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be weakened,” Prokhvatilov concluded. Not a priority: the United States began to lose interest in Ukraine Against the backdrop of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Washington reported that the possibilities of supplying weapons to Kyiv are not unlimited. The day before, the American portal Axios reported that the Pentagon plans to send tens of thousands of 155-mm artillery shells to Israel, which were postponed for Ukraine in US stockpiles several months ago. Beginning in early 2023, the US began removing 155mm artillery shells from its significant ammunition stockpile in Israel to send them to Ukraine. At the time, the Israeli military told the country's authorities that there were no threats in which Israel would need emergency supplies of shells. However, the situation changed on October 7, when militants from the Palestinian Hamas movement attacked Israel. On that day, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) assessed its needs for weapons and handed them over to the Pentagon. In particular, tens of thousands of 155mm artillery shells were requested to replenish the depleted US stockpile in Israel in case the Israeli military needs to use them, the Zvezda TV channel reported. Sources told the publication about the US agreement to the arms transfer. The Pentagon will send the ammunition in the coming weeks. The ammunition destined for Ukraine was part of a US arsenal of weapons stored in Israel as part of an agreement between the countries. Only US military personnel have access to weapons storage areas. But, according to an agreement between the countries, Israel can use the shells in war at short notice with US approval. Israel received access to the ammunition during the war with Lebanon in 2006, as well as during the Gaza conflict in 2014. On the same day, It is known that the President of the United States of America, Joe Biden, intends to request about $60 billion from Congress, which will be used to help Kyiv. According to his plans, Ukraine will receive the lion's share of the aid package totaling $100 billion, which will also be distributed between Taiwan, Israel and the US Southern Border Security Project. On October 15, Biden said that the United States has the ability to simultaneously support Ukraine and Israel. He noted that the United States will be able to ensure “international security.” Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to hold it was announced on February 24, 2022 amid the worsening situation in the region.

"22 May 2023","Portugal cannot send F-16 fighters to Ukraine, since it itself needs these aircraft. This was stated by the country's Foreign Minister Joao Gomes Carvinho on May 22. “We have combat aircraft that we need to fulfill our national obligations, as well as obligations to NATO, so for now the question of sending F-16s to Ukraine is not raised,” he said he was after a meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union countries. At the same time, Carvinho noted that Portugal is ready to train Ukrainian pilots to fly the F-16. No runway: The United States will continue consultations on the supply of F-16s to Kiev Russia called Western plans to send fighters to Ukraine a move towards escalation On May 21, US President Joe Biden said that he had outlined to Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky the plans of Western countries to train Ukrainian pilots to fly the F-16 and other military aircraft. Zelensky in response thanked Biden for the financial assistance provided by the United States to Kyiv, which already amounted to $37 billion, and for the new package of military assistance. Earlier, on May 20, White House National Security Assistant Jake Sullivan said that Washington and its allies in the coming months will decide which countries and in what quantity will send F-16 fighters to Kyiv. Denmark and Great Britain have already expressed their readiness to train Ukrainian pilots to work on this type of aircraft. On May 17, the head of the German Ministry of Defense, Boris Pistorius, emphasized that Germany does not have the military equipment and necessary capabilities to take an active part in the coalition to supply fighter aircraft to Kiev. Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen on May 3 called the issue of transferring F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine difficult. He pointed to the continuation of the discussion on this matter. At the same time, Finnish President Sauli Niinistö emphasized that the republic is not going to transfer its fighters to Ukraine, since it needs them itself. At the same time, he indicated the country’s readiness to continue to support Kiev. On May 2, the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Dmitry Kuleba said that the decision on the supply of F-16 fighters to Kyiv would depend on the results of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. He also noted that if Ukraine already had F-16s, the counteroffensive “would have been faster.” The West has strengthened military and financial support for Ukraine against the backdrop of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass, which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24 last year against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.

"31 July 2023","Kyiv rejects all ideas of mediation: it is fixated on the logic of Russia’s ultimatums, which they are trying to package Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky into a “peace formula.” Alexey Polishchuk, director of the second department of the CIS countries of the Russian Foreign Ministry, stated this on July 31. According to him, the Russian Federation appreciates the desire of friends from the countries of the Global South to contribute to a political and diplomatic way out of the Ukrainian crisis. He noted that about 20 states and associations have already come up with similar initiatives, including China, Brazil and African countries. “It’s good that our partners want to understand the essence of the current problems, to understand the underlying causes that led to them. The reasons for the events that have undermined the architecture of European and global security for many years,” he told RIA Novosti. Polishchuk also noted that Russia shares their confidence that the main results of the negotiation process should be the establishment of peace in Europe, the restoration of Russian-Ukrainian cooperation, the creation of a new security system, the formation of non-confrontational relations between Russia and NATO. “However, in Kyiv all ideas of mediation are rejected. They are blindly fixated on the logic of Russia’s ultimatums, which are trying to elegantly package Zelensky’s “peace formulas” in a spectacular wrapper,” he said. At the same time, he assured that the Russian side intends to continue the dialogue on the prospects for a peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian crisis with Chinese, Brazilian, African and other partners. “The US and NATO refuse to negotiate on equal security for all” At the Russia-Africa summit, leaders discussed the cause and resolution of the Ukrainian crisis, debt relief and grain supplies At the Russia-Africa summit on July 29, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the conflict in Ukraine should end peacefully, since this is beneficial to both sides. The Russian leader noted that the proposed initiatives for a peaceful settlement of the situation have been studied in detail and are highly appreciated. Official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova shared on the same day on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa summit that Moscow has received about 30 peace initiatives for a settlement in Ukraine through various channels. She said that the Russian Federation never refused negotiations, but Ukraine “left the negotiations that it itself asked for.” On July 28, Putin noted that all problems should be resolved during negotiations, but NATO and Ukraine refuse them, including issues security.

"29 March 2023","The Russian Foreign Ministry condemns the eviction of monks of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) from the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Deputy head of the ministry Sergei Ryabkov announced this on March 29. “Those who do this do not fear God. If this means nothing to them, then they will face the judgment of history and legal prosecution. But this is a question for the future. We condemn this categorically. The Kiev regime has put itself outside the law,” he told Izvestia. Ryabkov expressed solidarity and support for those who are in the bosom of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), and wished strength of spirit, will, firmness in realizing the rightness of the leaders of the UOC. “Goals of the SVO will be achieved, and those responsible for the current lawlessness will be punished,” he noted. There is no faith: why are the Ukrainian authorities blocking access to holy relics? The UOC called the events in the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra an unprecedented restriction of the rights of believers. Earlier on this day, when the ultimatum to the monks of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra expired, hundreds of parishioners came to the temple. According to Izvestia, about 200 people gathered on the street near the temple. Believers of different ages came to the monastery - from young people to the elderly. Every inch of the temple is occupied - it is impossible to enter the building. It is reported that no one is showing aggression at the moment. On March 21, the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine announced the closure of part of the territory of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra due to identified violations. At the same time, the country’s leadership gave the clergy an ultimatum, according to which security forces would be sent to the Lavra to resolve the situation if they did not leave the monastery. Earlier, on March 10, a warning was published on the monastery’s website signed by the acting. General Director of the National Reserve ""Kievo-Pechersk Lavra"" Alexander Rudnik that the monks of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra must leave the monastery before March 29, 2023. In 2022, the Ukrainian authorities intensified actions directed against the UOC. They conducted searches of bishops and priests, churches and monasteries, including the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in order to find traces of “anti-Ukrainian activities.” Thus, in December 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) opened 50 criminal cases against priests of the UOC.

We expect intensive engagement with Congress this week as we work on this package and look for bipartisan support,” he said. “It’s unlikely that the Abrams will go to Ukraine, they could be transferred to Israel” Diplomat Konstantin Gavrilov - about the impact of the situation in the Middle East on the course of the Northern Military District and the West’s dissatisfaction with Zelensky Earlier that day, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke about the start of delivery of a significant part of aid to Israel in the field of security from the American side. He also noted that the United States intends to “make clear that it supports Israel” and seeks to prevent an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. As Biden said on October 15, the United States has the ability to simultaneously support Ukraine and Israel. He noted that the United States will be able to provide “ international security.” Meanwhile, former adviser to ex-President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin said that Ukrainians need to prepare for the cessation of US assistance due to the worsening situation in the Middle East. The ex-adviser stressed that the cessation of support from Washington will happen in November due to the situation with Israel. Europe will also not be able to help Ukraine. Back on October 13, former CIA analyst Larry Johnson said that the United States will not be able to simultaneously support Ukraine and Israel. He believes that the pro-Israeli lobby in the United States is stronger than the pro-Ukrainian one, so Tel Aviv will receive supplies as a priority. On the morning of October 7, Hamas subjected Israeli territory to massive rocket fire from the Gaza Strip, and also invaded the border areas in the south of the country. That same day, Israel began retaliating against targets in the Gaza Strip and later announced the launch of Operation Iron Swords. According to the latest data, since the beginning of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the Gaza Strip, 2.7 thousand Palestinians have been killed, and over 10 thousand residents of the region have been injured. Meanwhile, as a result of Hamas attacks, more than 1.4 thousand Israelis were killed and 3.5 thousand were injured. At the same time, Western countries increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the background of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which has been carried out since February 24, 2022.

"12 May 2023","petition has appeared on the website of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to cancel Europe Day and return to the celebration of Victory Day. The document was published on May 11. “I ask the President of Ukraine to return the holiday of May 9 (Victory Day) and cancel the Europe Day holiday. Our grandfathers fought not for Russia, but for Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union, so there is no point in canceling this holiday,” the appeal says. At the moment, the petition has received 182 votes out of 25 thousand required for its consideration. Parade tradition: how Russia celebrated Victory Day In Moscow, they warmed up with military songs and dances to “Smuglyanka,” and the “Immortal Flotilla” passed along the rivers of St. Petersburg. The Ukrainian leader earlier, on May 8, signed a decree on celebrating Europe Day in the country on May 9. The Kyiv authorities explained that such a decision was made in order to strengthen the unity of the peoples of Europe. In addition, Zelensky proposed celebrating May 8 as the Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in World War II. After this, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that there are many people in Ukraine for whom May 9 is a sacred day. And for veterans who took part in the Great Patriotic War, as well as for their relatives and friends, this day will and will remain sacred, he added. State Duma deputy from the Crimean region Mikhail Sheremet, in turn, said that this decision of Zelensky is a betrayal of the Ukrainian people. He believes that Victory Day will definitely return to Ukraine in its usual format as soon as it is liberated from the power of the Nazis. On February 13, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine proposed canceling the celebration of March 8, Labor Day and Victory Day. Later, on February 16, the website of the President of Ukraine appeared an electronic petition demanding that the celebration of Victory Day on May 9 be preserved as a public holiday. The Ukrainian authorities continue to sever ties with Russia and abandon their common history. Back in 2014, the country canceled the celebration of Defender of the Fatherland Day on February 23.

"April 25 2023","Ukraine and the West need Crimea in order to gain control over shipping in the Black Sea. Ben Hodges, the former commander of NATO forces in Europe, said this on April 24 in an interview with Newsweek. “This is important not only because we want Ukraine to have an economy. This is also important for the European Union. <…> If you take a step back, look away from Crimea and look at the Black Sea, it becomes painfully obvious to you that Russia can block ships of any type entering and leaving Ukrainian ports. I don’t know that, but I think that is one of the main goals of the upcoming Ukrainian offensive,” he said. Hodges also voiced the opinion that Ukraine needs more Western long-range weapons to achieve an advantage. Inglorious attempts: Ukrainian counterattacks in Artemovsk failed. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and our units liberated several more blocks. Earlier, on April 21, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said in a video message that the main task of the state is to return the territories. At the same time, in the comments to the broadcast and material on this topic, some readers of the German publication Die Welt were skeptical about the words of the Ukrainian leader. On April 19, columnist Uwe Parpart, in an article for the Asia Times, expressed the opinion that if the United States and other NATO member countries try to help Ukraine to seize Crimea, this could be crossing a red line for Russia. At the same time, Parpart emphasized, the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) have become even more precarious due to a lack of ammunition, as well as large losses, so the Kyiv authorities are unlikely to be able to independently carry out a counter-offensive and seize Crimea. The day before, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after negotiations with his Venezuelan colleague Ivan Gil called the statements of the Kyiv regime about the return of Crimea demagogic. As the diplomat emphasized, the conflict in Ukraine and other geopolitical problems must be resolved on the basis of the principle of indivisible security, he pointed out. At the end of February, Zelensky indicated that Ukrainian forces are ready “morally and technically” to seize the peninsula. In addition, in early April, he called the return of the peninsula to Ukraine as the only option for both Kyiv and the whole world. Crimea became a Russian region in March 2014 following a referendum after the coup in Ukraine. Kyiv still considers Crimea its territory. The Russian leadership has repeatedly stated that the residents of the republic voted for reunification democratically, in full compliance with international law and the UN Charter.

"28 February 2024","Attempts by the Ukrainian authorities to solve the problem of the lack of manpower on the battlefield at the expense of foreign mercenaries have failed, their recruitment through diplomatic missions is not effective, said Rodion Miroshnik, Ambassador of the Russian Foreign Ministry for Special Assignments for the crimes of the Kiev regime, on February 28. He recalled that Ukraine publishes instructions on the resources of the missions on how foreigners can sign a contract and go to Ukraine. “This is a direct violation of the international canons of diplomatic and consular activity, but nevertheless, in a number of countries they turn a blind eye to this, and Ukrainian foreign missions work as recruiting centers. True, today this activity is not particularly effective,” RIA Novosti quotes the diplomat. At the same time, the scheme for collecting, training and delivering mercenaries to Ukraine is most often built through private military companies, the diplomat added, about a dozen of them have been identified, in particular European Security Academy. However, the recruitment of mercenaries through diplomatic departments is not effective, since “disposal of one’s own population at the front is much cheaper,” and in addition, “the attitude of the mercenaries themselves to participating in hostilities against the Russian army has changed.” Miroshnik emphasized that if in In Syria, Iraq or other hot spots where the customers are the Anglo-Saxons, “there are agreements, there is reverence, but here there is none.” “There is an uncompromising battle here and the fate of mercenaries, if they fall into the field of action of our military, is, to put it mildly, unenviable. Therefore, the initial attempts to solve the problem of the lack of manpower on the battlefield on the Ukrainian side at the expense of mercenaries failed,” he said. Earlier that day, the Chairman of the Investigative Committee (IC) of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin, noted that the identities of 593 mercenaries from 46 states fighting in side of Kyiv. Most of the identified persons are citizens of the USA, Georgia, Great Britain, Canada, Israel, Germany, Lithuania and Latvia. Earlier, on February 16, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced the need to fight mercenarism in Ukraine. According to him, less than half of the foreign mercenaries remained in the country. Prior to this, on February 14, a captured mercenary of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), Georgian citizen Georgiy Chubetidze, said that most of the mercenaries in the International Legion of the Ukrainian Army are drug addicts and criminals who have committed serious crimes. He clarified that most mercenaries have no pity for civilians. “We are wasting time and losing our lives in vain” Colombian mercenaries of the Ukrainian Armed Forces complained of deception and became disillusioned with the conflict in Ukraine The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues.

"28 February 2024","Moscow will view any form of European military presence in Ukraine as an escalation. The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, announced this on Wednesday, February 28, during a briefing. Commenting on the recent statement by French President Emmanuel Macron about the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine, the diplomat noted that such a decision would be an escalation of the conflict. “There are no risks here, this is escalation. Each supply of weapons leads to escalation, the next tranche that goes towards the war carried out by the Kyiv regime is escalation,” the diplomat noted. At the same time, she emphasized that the appearance of military personnel from the European Union countries in Ukraine through new forms of mercenarism also will become “directly an escalation.” Earlier during the briefing, Zakharova emphasized that agreements between Ukraine and Western countries on security guarantees confirm the goal of Western capitals for long-term confrontation with Russia. The diplomat also expressed confidence that European taxpayers did not make a choice in favor of supporting the Kyiv regime, Washington made it for them. Supplies are at a standstill: what critical weapons could Kyiv be left without? Reducing Western aid not only deprives Ukraine of the ability to attack, but also reduces its defense capabilities. On February 26, Macron announced the possibility of sending ground forces of Western countries to Ukraine. His proposal faced criticism not only in France itself, but also in the international arena. In particular, the French leader’s statement was not supported in the USA, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, Great Britain, Germany, Lithuania and Canada. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also spoke out against it. In addition, the absence of such plans was stated by the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Alliance, Jens Stoltenberg.

"October 2023","The US Armed Forces may abandon the M1 Abrams tanks due to the poor survivability of the equipment, which manifested itself in the conflict in Ukraine. This was reported by the online publication Asia Times on Monday, October 9. “A US Army study recommended phasing out the M1 Abrams tank in favor of lighter, smaller unmanned vehicles, citing survivability problems experienced on the battlefield <…> in Ukraine,” the publication writes. The study reportedly highlights the need for a next-generation M1 variant equipped with larger caliber guns, as well as hypersonic anti-tank missiles. The US Army Science Board also predicts that tanks and armored vehicles will face new threats in the future from modern anti-tank weapons, drones and artificial intelligence capabilities. Forces from heaven: the Airborne Forces will be reinforced with tanks and helicopters How will this affect the combat capabilities of the “winged infantry” To date, the United States has supplied 31 Abrams tanks of outdated configuration to Ukraine. As American ex-marine Matthew Ho noted at the end of September, the United States is transferring outdated combat vehicles to Ukraine because modern Russian forces can easily intercept the supplied equipment, and the American leadership does not want new tanks to fall into the hands of the Russian Armed Forces. At the same time, a Russian soldier with the call sign Zhuk told Izvestia that Russian tanks have several advantages over Abrams. According to him, at a minimum, American armored vehicles are heavier, longer and higher compared to Russian ones, which allows them to inflict maximum damage. In the same month, ex-US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter noted that the delivery of Abrams to Kyiv gives Moscow the opportunity to show the whole world how American armored vehicles burn. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine after the start of Russia’s special operation to protect Donbass. The decision to hold it was announced on February 24, 2022 amid the worsening situation in the region.

"March 2024","European taxpayers have the right to know how their money sent to Ukraine was spent. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó said this on March 6. “As for EU funds sent to Ukraine, I believe that every European taxpayer has the right to know where the money of European taxpayers ended up and what it was used for,” he was quoted as saying. RIA Novosti. According to Szijjártó, Hungary has always pointed out that Europeans have this right when the European Union (EU) decided to support Ukraine. Losing the EU: aid to Kyiv worsens the economies of European countries How much more money and on what terms did the European Union decide to allocate to Ukraine? Earlier, on February 27, the European Parliament voted for a new fund to help Ukraine worth €50 billion. Before that, on February 1, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said that all 27 leaders of EU member states at the summit in Brussels agreed to allocate an additional €50 billion as part of a support package for Ukraine from the union budget. On February 6, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the European Union intends to begin the first payments to Ukraine from the €50 fund billion in March.

"14 March 2023","In Tbilisi, a fight broke out near the Georgian Parliament building; members of the Conservative Movement party, or the far-right organization Alt-info, were tearing down the flags of the European Union, the Tbilisi life Telegram channel reported on Tuesday, March 14. The police have already intervened in what is happening. Later it became known that the protest participants set fire to the EU flag and installed a Georgian one instead, the report says. “In Georgia there is only one flag - the flag of Georgia,” said one of the founders of the far-right organization Alt-info Zurab Makharadze. Now the participants of the procession have blocked the center Tbilisi, there are clashes with the police. In addition, as the chairman of the Ilya Chavchavadze Center for European Studies and Civic Education Zaza Bibilashvili said, supporters of the “Conservative Movement” threw a stone at the organization’s building, Tbilisi life notes. As the media write, the Secretary General of the Conservative Movement Shota Martynenko said, that burning the EU flag is now a tradition, demanding that the authorities release those detained for violence against journalists on July 5, 2021. The publication also states that supporters of the far-right party and the Alt-info media platform are demanding a referendum on the adoption of the law “on foreign agents.” On March 7 and 8, large-scale protests took place in Tbilisi after the country’s parliament adopted the bill in the first reading “ On the transparency of foreign influence."" The document envisaged the creation of a register of non-governmental organizations and media that are funded from abroad. On March 9, the unrest continued. As a result, the ruling Georgian Dream party and the Power of the People party jointly announced the withdrawal of the bill from parliament. On March 12, Georgian politician, leader of the Justice party Igor Giorgadze, in a conversation with Izvestia, noted that demonstrations, overturned cars, arson in Tbilisi - this is a “test of opposition forces”, the program for which was prepared by Western countries, mainly Americans. The surge in rallies is a reason, not a reason, the publication’s interlocutor emphasized. He pointed out: when the Georgian government spoke about its own interests, which were not directed against Russia, “this was enough for the Americans to press the button, which is painted in a rainbow color.” On March 11, Georgian Brigadier General Tristan Tsitelashvili told Izvestia that the protests in Tbilisi is a planned provocation by US intelligence services to change power. He announced the US desire to open a second front in Georgia. A day earlier, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasized that the protests in Georgia regarding the bill on foreign agents were only a pretext for an attempt to forcefully change power, and the situation itself is very reminiscent of the Maidan in Ukraine. He compared the protests in Georgia and Moldova, noting that Western countries react to them differently. Tbilisi, according to Lavrov, is controlled from the outside and events there benefit Western customers.

"11 July 2023","Cooperation between Ukraine and NATO will not lead to anything good. Viktor Vodolatsky, first deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on CIS Affairs, Eurasian Integration and Relations with Compatriots, told Izvestia on July 11. This is how he responded to the information that the North Atlantic Alliance summit approved a multi-year program of military assistance to Kyiv and the creation of the Ukraine-NATO Council “This is a carrot that was tied around the donkey’s neck, and so he runs after it, but he will never catch up. So Ukraine is like a donkey today - it was shown the carrot that it will someday join NATO, but someday, according to the NATO council program, it will be when they completely destroy Ukraine, which is what they are striving for. Councils such as Ukraine - NATO will not lead Ukraine to anything good, there will only be a continuation of escalation on the line of special operations,” the deputy said. NATO has a reason: what decisions on Ukraine will be made at the summit in Vilnius And how is the process of Sweden joining the alliance progressing Earlier that day, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky was indignant because the North Atlantic Alliance does not intend to make specific decisions on the timing of inviting the country to NATO at the summit in Vilnius on July 11–12. On July 5, the North Atlantic Alliance confirmed the decision to create a Ukraine-NATO council. The first meeting of the council will be held at the summit in Vilnius on July 12 at the level of heads of state. First Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Vladimir Dzhabarov, in a conversation with Izvestia, said that the Ukraine-NATO council is a response to Zelensky’s grievances. Ukraine September 30, 2022 submitted an application to join NATO on an accelerated basis. Then Zelensky said that in fact Ukraine is already in NATO and meets the standards of the alliance.

"December 1 2023","Ukraine will not be able to regain control of Crimea. This statement was made by US Republican Senator Randal Paul in an interview with the YouTube channel Daniel Davis Deep Dive, published on November 30. “Physically, I just don’t see a way that they will ever be able to push the Russians […] out of eastern Ukraine, and I don’t I see a way to return Crimea,” he said. According to Paul, Kyiv should have agreed to a neutral status last year - this was the only way to complete the special operation, he believes. Now the situation has reached a dead end. “We need to understand where we are. The Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces [Valery Zaluzhny] says that this is a dead end. They indicate to us that we have reached a point from which we could begin negotiations; in fact, we were [in the same position] about a year ago. Tens of thousands of people died, and we simply returned to the same point,” he emphasized. “We should not expect a complete settlement of the Ukrainian crisis in the near future” Political scientist Denis Denisov on the situation in Ukraine Earlier that day, the former commander of the Polish ground forces, General Waldemar Skrzypczak, also said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) currently have no chance of returning the territories, lost during the conflict with Russia. Skrzypchak noted that, according to the military, it is impossible to break through Russia’s defense line in the south and in the Donbass, and as a result, Ukraine will eventually have to sit down at the negotiating table. Prior to this, on November 27, the former US ambassador to NATO, head of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs Affairs Ivo Daalder noted that the West should abandon the task of restoring the borders of Ukraine by military means and focus on providing security guarantees for that part of the country that is still under the control of Kyiv. At the same time, according to Daalder, by leaving behind Russia the territories that it currently controls, the United States and its allies should “offer Ukraine a reliable security guarantee.” Prior to this, on November 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin recalled that Moscow had never refused peace negotiations on Ukraine. According to him, any military action is always a tragedy and it is necessary to “think about how to stop this tragedy.” At the same time, on November 20, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky opposed holding peace negotiations with Russia, despite the difficult situation of the Ukrainian army. He indicated that he excludes friendship with the Russian Federation. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced on February 24, 2022, continues.

"26 August 2023","conflict is brewing between the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) and NATO due to the failure of the counteroffensive, and this will play into the hands of the Russian army. This was stated on Friday, August 25, by a military expert, combat veteran, captain of the first rank in the reserve, Vasily Dandykin. “There they began to swear and shift the blame onto each other. The Ukrainian Armed Forces say that NATO members are to blame, NATO members say that Ukrainian troops are to blame. This is good. When there is discord in their team, this is normal for us. When the owner feeds the dog, it should not bite his hand,” he said in an interview with URA.RU. A military expert suggested that in the fall the Russian Armed Forces could intensify the offensive, since the Ukrainian Armed Forces are now using their last reserves. “Now they have launched the last reserves where the fighting is going on in Zaporozhye. In active defense, the summer is behind us. And autumn will tell. <…> The enemy is still motivated, but I have a cautious sense of optimism,” Dandykin said. Counter-offensive on Ukraine: why the West is talking about a truce with Russia Kyiv is preparing for a “difficult political season” Earlier, on August 22, US presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. condemned the fact that Americans are being misinformed about the situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He noted that even the leading American media are beginning to admit the collapse of Kiev’s counter-offensive. On August 17, US House of Representatives member Andrew Harris admitted the failure of Ukraine’s counter-offensive and expressed doubt about the advisability of Washington providing further support to Kyiv without proper oversight. Prior to this, on August 13, the Ukrainian edition of UNIAN stated that the NATO military leadership was to blame for the failure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ summer offensive. Military instructors of the North Atlantic Alliance, in turn, said that the main problem of the unsuccessful summer counter-offensive is related to the inability of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to conduct combined arms combat, and Western doctrines and advisers have nothing to do with it. A special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last years, continues.

On November 6, Vladimir Zelensky said that in the current situation, holding presidential elections in Ukraine would be an untimely event. He also called on everyone to focus on defense issues and work in unity. The US State Department called Zelensky’s decision consistent with the Ukrainian constitution. At the same time, political scientist Ivan Mezyukho, in a conversation with Izvestia, pointed out the uncertainty of the United States regarding the issue of elections in Ukraine. Back in early October, Zelensky indicated that he did not intend to run for a second term if elections were held after the end of hostilities.

"February 2024","Switzerland, which proposed organizing a conference on a peaceful settlement in Ukraine, cannot be an impartial mediator, since it itself participates in anti-Russian sanctions, openly siding with Kyiv. This was stated on January 6 by Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations (UN) office and other international organizations in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov. The diplomat recalled that several countries had previously proposed starting peace negotiations, among which, in particular, was China. “Now there is Switzerland. But she can no longer be an impartial mediator. She is no longer neutral. She openly sided with Ukraine,” Gatilov said in an interview with the Swiss newspaper Le Temps. He noted that Switzerland has joined sanctions against the Russian Federation, which are unilateral and illegal. “How can Switzerland declare its neutrality after this? For us, therefore, it is unacceptable for her to organize peace negotiations,” stated the permanent representative of the Russian Federation. Swiss world: The West has made an attempt to enter into a dialogue with the Russian Federation on Ukraine Can Bern become a mediator in resolving the conflict and who needs it more?

"January 20 2024","Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky asked for peace talks at the Davos Economic Forum, but Washington is desperate to get new funding to continue the Ukrainian conflict. US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said this on January 19. “Zelensky in Switzerland is asking for peace talks, and warmongers in Washington are desperately trying to finance the continuation of hostilities in Ukraine for $60 billion. This is stupid,” she wrote on the social network X (formerly Twitter). As Green noted, supporters of allocating new money to Kyiv are proving that the Ukrainian conflict is “America’s war.” “No more money for Ukraine! Let them make peace,” the congresswoman urged. What needed to be exhausted: the United States no longer has money for Ukraine Will Washington be able to find funds for all external conflicts on the eve of the presidential election? Earlier this day, columnist Josh Rogin wrote in an article for The Washington Post that the prospects for a compromise agreement on Ukraine and migration policy by the US House of Representatives this month are close to zero, and “even less in the coming months.” On January 18, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said that the United States would approve the allocation of another aid package to Kyiv “any day” as soon as congressmen agree on resolving the issue on the southern border of the country. On the same day, American President Joe Biden said that the issue of allocating further assistance to Ukraine from the United States rests on the minority in Congress. According to him, “the majority of Republicans” are in favor of helping Kyiv. The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, after a meeting with Biden, said that the chances of reaching an agreement on financing Ukraine in the American Congress exceed 50%. In turn, Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the US Senate next week could begin work on Biden's request for national security purposes, including assistance to Ukraine. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said it was impossible to provide assistance to Ukraine bypassing the US Congress. Political scientist, senior lecturer at MGIMO University of the Russian Foreign Ministry Alexei Zudin said in an interview with Izvestia that military assistance to Ukraine from the United States will continue, but will be reduced. It is noted that support will continue even if agreements are not reached within the American establishment.

Strategic Communications Coordinator in the White House National Security Council, John Kirby indicated that Washington is not yet preparing new packages of military assistance to Ukraine due to the lack of budgetary funds for this. In turn, Assistant to the US President for National Security Jake Sullivan said that the White House will attempt to achieve the allocation of American congress of assistance to Kyiv in the coming weeks. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg believes that the US Congress will still be able to approve a new aid package to Ukraine, even despite the existing disagreements.

On January 3, he noted that the American aid package sent to Kiev on December 27 would be the last for now. This aid package worth up to $250 million included weapons and equipment. Prior to this, on December 6, Republicans blocked the Senate from considering the White House's request for funds for Ukraine, Israel and other needs. In exchange for concessions on the bill, they demanded changes in approaches to border security.

"13 July 2023","The decision to supply Kyiv with long-range SCALP missiles is an irresponsible step on the part of French President Emmanuel Macron, the leader of the French right-wing National Rally party, Marine Le Pen, said on July 12, her words were quoted by the newspaper Le Monde. The politician noted that she does not understand why the French leader does not organize peace negotiations to end the conflict. In her opinion, the supply of weapons that could be used to attack a “third country” could lead to a third world war. “We don’t know what kind of reaction they might have a third country that will be affected by weapons supplied by France,” noted the leader of the French party. France decided to transfer missiles to Ukraine on July 11. According to Macron, Paris adheres to a doctrine aimed at allowing Kyiv to defend its territory. Cassette pass: Kyiv quarrels London and Washington before the NATO summit What caused the split between the allies and why the “special relationship” between the US and Great Britain is coming to an end This decision was also criticized by other French politicians. Thus, the leader of the French right-wing Patriots party, Florian Philippot, called the supply of long-range missiles to Ukraine madness. In turn, the Russian Embassy in Paris noted that France must be aware of responsibility for the decision to supply SCALP missiles to Ukraine. Kremlin official Dmitry Peskov called this decision erroneous, but not affecting the course of the special operation to protect Donbass.

"January 29 2024","On January 29, political scientist Yuriy Svetov, in a conversation with Izvestia, expressed the opinion that the decision on the resignation of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Valery Zaluzhny will be agreed upon with the United States. “I believe that there should be a decree. Even if the decree is signed by (Ukrainian President Vladimir - Ed.) Zelensky, then it must be initialed by (US President Joe - Ed.) Biden, because they cannot do this without the permission of the Americans. Here, Mr. (Head of the Servant of the People faction in the parliament, David. - Ed.) Arakhamia, in a recent interview, once admitted that Ukraine is forced to give up a certain amount of sovereignty for the purpose of its struggle. If three inspectors have come to Ukraine now and will look at whether they are using weapons correctly and how ammunition is being spent there, then in such a matter, who will be the commander, the Americans will naturally decide, and not Zelensky, as was the case with Minister of Defense Alexey Reznikov,” said Svetov. As the political scientist noted, the appointment of Rustem Umerov to the post of Minister of Defense of Ukraine was preceded by his trip to the United States, where he accompanied Zelensky’s wife. “The Americans looked at him, estimated, then gave the go-ahead for him to became Minister of Defense. That’s why Zelensky can’t remove it so easily now,” he believes. “Bug” of discord: what will the new conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny lead to The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine accused the president of failing to mobilize. Earlier that day, former Verkhovna Rada deputy Borislav Bereza announced Zaluzhny’s removal from office. Rada deputy Alexey Goncharenko (included in the list of terrorists and extremists of Rosfinmonitoring) also confirmed information about the resignation of the commander-in-chief. However, later the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the press secretary of the country's president Sergei Nikiforov denied information about Zaluzhny's resignation. Information about conflicts between the Ukrainian leader and the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine appeared after November 1, when Zaluzhny, in an interview with The Economist, said that Ukrainian troops could not achieve a breakthrough because the conflict had reached a dead end. Then he emphasized that prolongation of hostilities carries great risks for Ukraine. On November 4, Zelensky expressed disagreement with Zaluzhny’s opinion. The President admitted that the offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is difficult, since the Russian Armed Forces control the skies, but “this is not a stalemate.” At the same time, the deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, Igor Zhovkva, noted that Zaluzhny’s statement was inappropriate and caused panic among the leadership of Western countries. The need for Zaluzhny’s resignation was announced on November 26 by the deputy head of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Committee on National Security Issues, Maryana Bezuglaya. She indicated that the commander-in-chief did not provide a military action plan for the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2024. Also, The Economist reported on November 28 that the cause of the conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny was the failure of the counteroffensive. In addition, journalists noted that the relationship between the president and the commander-in-chief deteriorated after Zaluzhny’s interview with The Economist in early November, in which the general called the Ukrainian conflict a dead end for Kiev. In turn, Bezuglaya on January 26 shared her opinion that Zaluzhny could be replaced by one of the three Ukrainian military officials. According to her, they include the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Kirill Budanov, the commander of the ground forces Alexander Syrsky and the deputy commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Evgeniy Moisyuk.

"September 2023","Complaints by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky about mobilization evaders are a worrying sign. This opinion was expressed by retired Bundeswehr colonel and military expert Wolfgang Richter, writes Die Welt. “Yes, of course, this is an alarming signal, but I think the experts have known about this for a long time. This shows that the image of Ukraine, united by patriotism, is only partly true,” he answered a question from journalists about whether the president’s public complaints are a signal of distress. Richter also emphasized that Kyiv’s statements are intended to some extent “put pressure” on West, but first of all this speaks of problems within the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU).

This opinion was expressed by the ex-adviser to the former President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma Oleg Soskin on his YouTube channel on Monday, December 25. He is convinced that the citizens of Ukraine no longer want to fight for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky. “The authorities are Zelensky, the servants of the people, the whole this elite is aimed at continuing “combat operations” by exterminating hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. They decided to recruit another 500 thousand cannon fodder and throw it to the front,” the expert said. In addition, according to Soskin, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are running out of ammunition and weapons provided by Western countries. Reserves have been depleted, and yet new aid packages in states allied to Kyiv have not yet been approved. They are changing gender: what will the mobilization of women in Ukraine lead to? Future soldiers are caught in bars, sanatoriums and gyms. Earlier in the day, former CIA officer Larry Johnson said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who were forcibly sent to the special operation zone, refuse to carry out Zelensky’s orders. According to him, there are more and more signs that the soldiers are opposed to Zelensky and are ignoring his orders, so he is in real trouble. Prior to this, on December 19, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky at a press conference spoke about the military’s proposal in connection with failures at the front to call about 500 thousand more people.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine noted that this is how the Americans “save the lives of their soldiers,” which is “ the best offer on the market"" for the United States. ""The Ukrainian Foreign Minister admits that his regime has little or no concern for the lives of its people. “You will be able to protect your most important resource - your soldiers” (this means that we will allow ours to die en masse).

On December 20, military historian Yuri Knutov told Izvestia that the Ukrainian military did not realize that today they have already become hostages of the policies pursued by the Kiev regime. At the same time, the American newspaper The Wall Street Journal reported that the Ukrainian military admits that news about failures at the front discourages citizens of the country from joining the army. The publication notes that the Kiev leadership hoped that the counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces would eliminate the need to take “politically unpopular measures” to recruit young people in Kyiv. However, the failure led to the opposite. Prior to this, on December 19, former Verkhovna Rada deputy Igor Lapin admitted that the failure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine led to despair among the country's residents, because the authorities in Kyiv instilled false hopes in them.

As the authors indicated, for maintaining “active defense” The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) require a stable supply of artillery shells, which they lack. The day before, Reuters reported, citing an EU representative, that the union’s negotiations with Hungary on the transfer of financial and military assistance to Ukraine are going difficult, despite some concessions from the Hungarian side. It is noted that most EU countries want to come to an agreement on the annual transfer of €5 billion to Kyiv. Meanwhile, the Politico newspaper noted that without the help of European countries in the amount of €50 billion, for the allocation of which the heads of government of European countries can vote on February 1, Ukraine will be unable to continue military operations or support the destroyed economy. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the start of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 after the situation in the region worsened due to shelling from side of the Ukrainian military.

Reuters reported this on Monday, April 10, citing the Pentagon. According to the agency, the leak could become the most destructive publication of US government information since the publication of documents on WikiLeaks in 2013. At the same time, the agency does not rule out that documents published on the Internet may turn out to be fake. It is noted that the Pentagon is currently studying exactly how information is disseminated and who its recipient is.

"February 1 2024","Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with protesting farmers in the Belgian capital Brussels on January 31 and pointed out the existence of a democratic deficit in Europe. “Leaders (of European countries - Ed.) do not take the voice of the people seriously. This is problem number one. Are we talking about migration, about war, about Ukraine,” he told reporters in a video message published on the social network Facebook (owned by Meta, banned in the Russian Federation). According to Orban, the only way out of this situation may be a change of leadership in Brussels in during the elections to the European Parliament, which will take place in June this year. Spending business: Hungary opposed new funding for Ukraine And called for the start of peace negotiations Earlier, on January 30, Orban told Le Point that he was ready to make a common decision with the other 26 countries of the European Union (EU) on funding for Ukraine at the unification summit on February 1, if it will be guaranteed that the amount will be approved every year on a unanimous basis. The Financial Times (FT), citing a document from the European Union, wrote on January 29 that the EU could sabotage the Hungarian economy if it continues to impede the allocation of aid to Ukraine. It is assumed that the levers of pressure could be the exchange rate of the Hungarian forint and the level of investment attractiveness of Hungary. On December 1, the Politico newspaper wrote that the EU was heading towards a political crisis due to assistance to Ukraine and pressure from Hungary. It was noted that Orban is regularly “pushing the EU to the edge of the abyss, and diplomats are panicking that his hostility to Ukraine is about to finally push the bloc over the brink.” Western countries have increased military and financial support for Ukraine amid a Russian special operation to protect the Donbass , which began on February 24, 2022 after the situation worsened due to Ukrainian shelling.

The head of the Union of Old Believers, Leonid Sevastyanov, announced this on April 7 after a personal conversation with the pontiff. A truce is proposed to be established on April 9 during Easter for Catholics and Orthodox Christians. “The pope just told me that in honor of this he proposes that in the zone of a special military operation in Ukraine, all hostilities ceased for two weeks - for the Catholic and Orthodox Easter weeks,” TASS quotes Sevastyanov.

In his opinion, a temporary truce in the conflict will only lead to aggravation of the situation. In early January, Patriarch Kirill called for the establishment of a Christmas truce in the zone of a special military operation in Ukraine and Donbass. He called on the parties to the conflict to “cease fire” on January 7 so that people could attend services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

"13 September 2023","Many officials in Washington fear a domino effect—a situation in which the country suffers one defeat after another, leading to the loss of its hegemonic role on the world stage. Therefore, in particular, the Americans have still not agreed to negotiations with the Russian Federation on Ukraine, political scientist and Americanist Malek Dudakov said in a conversation with Izvestia on September 13. A few days earlier, American journalist Garland Nixon, on his YouTube channel, said that the U.S. are in conflict with Russia in order to maintain the role of hegemon on the world stage. In particular, he noted that the conflict in Ukraine is connected not only with Russia, but also with the “American Empire.” “Of course, the United States is fighting for its dominance in the world, including through the conflict in Ukraine. Another thing is that the question of what position the Americans will be in next will depend not only on the Ukrainian conflict. Many in Washington fear a domino effect - first the Afghan fiasco, then the defeat in Ukraine, Taiwan, and so on,” Dudakov noted. According to him, in this situation, the United States may lose its influence, new centers of power will emerge, which will be the beginning of the end for “The American Empire.” “Whether this happens or not, we’ll see. But nevertheless there are such concerns. This is one of the reasons why the Americans are so stubborn in Ukraine and are still not ready to enter into any negotiations with Russia. Although, perhaps, they will still be forced to do this in the coming months against the backdrop of the failure of the Ukrainian counteroffensive,” Dudakov concluded. The sum of the differences: what to expect from further negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine And why assessments of the progress of consultations by Moscow and Kiev do not coincide On September 12, Western officials expressed doubts about the success of the Ukrainian offensive in the fall. On the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted at the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum that The supply of Western equipment, in particular F-16 fighter jets and cluster munitions, to Ukraine only prolongs the conflict, but does not fundamentally change anything on the battlefield. At the same time, the president noted that there are no results of the Ukrainian counter-offensive, but there are losses of 71.5 thousand people. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian leader Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues.

"March 2024","On March 11, the Bundestag Defense Committee will discuss a leaked conversation between German officers discussing the attack on the Crimean Bridge. This was reported on the committee’s website on March 5. “The only item on the agenda is the federal government’s report on the publication of a wiretap of a telephone conversation between high-ranking officers about the Taurus cruise missile,” the message says. The meeting will be chaired by the head of the committee, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann. They drove a split: Germany is divided on the issue of sending the Taurus to Kyiv How the leak scandal will affect the image of the German authorities RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan published on March 1 a full transcript of the discussion by high-ranking German officers of possible attacks on the Crimean Bridge with Taurus missiles. This conversation also included a discussion about the supply of these missiles to Ukraine. In a fragment of an audio recording from representatives of the German Air Force, officers discussed how many of these shells would be needed to attack the Crimean Bridge and whether such a strike would be effective. The conversation took place between the head of the operations and exercises department of the Bundeswehr Air Force Command Frank Graefe, the BBC Bundeswehr inspector Ingo Gerhartz, the employee of the air operations center of the Bundeswehr Space Command Stefan Fenske and an employee of the same department named Frostedte. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on March 2 that the German authorities are engaged in investigation into the leak of a recording of a conversation between German officers, and called this situation a very serious problem. Bild reported then that Graefe was to blame for the incident because he connected to the conversation from Singapore through an unsecured network, creating a threat to the security of the conversation. The Ukrainian side is attempting to attack Russian territory against the backdrop of a special operation in the Donbass, the start of which was announced on February 24, 2022 of the year. In recent months, Kyiv has repeatedly insisted on the transfer of German long-range Taurus missiles, but has faced refusals. Scholz, in turn, opposes the supply of these weapons, since, according to him, this is dangerous by involving Germany in the conflict.

"10 February 2024","The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) are experiencing difficulties in the Kupyansk direction on the contact line. This was reported by retired General of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Sergei Krivonos. “The situation in Kupyansk has been discussed more than once, back in November I drew the attention of the public and the Ukrainian leadership to the fact that it is necessary to monitor what is happening in the Kupyansk direction, because the Russians are fighting with mathematical precision, in the sense that they are studying all the options and calculating the possibilities,” he said on the YouTube channel “Direct” on February 8. As Krivonos noted, the Armed Forces of Ukraine risk losing control over the Kupyanskaya railway in this area - a major transport hub that allows increasing the effectiveness of the transfer of military personnel throughout the front line.

He shared this information in an interview with The Sun newspaper, published on Tuesday, November 21, on YouTube. “I don’t know exactly, but I think there were at least five or six,” Zelensky said. The President of Ukraine said that he was panicking caused only the first murder attempt, and he compared further attempts to the coronavirus pandemic, noting that “after the first time it became easier.” “The first time is the most interesting. After that, it’s like with COVID. At first, people don’t know what to do, and it’s scary,” the Ukrainian leader said.

A day earlier, The Guardian newspaper wrote that the Ukrainian leader is concerned that he may be defeated in the presidential elections, which may take place in the spring of 2024. According to the publication, this fear is associated with the growing popularity of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), Valeriy Zaluzhny, with whom the president allegedly has a conflict. The article also notes that opposition Ukrainian politicians are increasingly saying that when the conflict ends, questions of Zelensky’s competence as president will be raised again.

"13 November 2023","The United States curtailed some work on military biology after statements by the Russian Ministry of Defense. This was stated on November 13 by the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defense forces of the Russian Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. The presenter of the Rossiya 24 TV channel asked Kirillov about how rivals react to these statements. “Most often they remain silent. Sometimes they are instructed not to react at all. They curtailed some of the work, and we believe that this is our achievement,” Kirillov said on the TV channel. The lieutenant general emphasized that with its statements Russia managed to reach many countries and prompted their leadership to think that it is probably worth thinking about about what the Pentagon is actually doing on their territory. To support his point of view, Kirillov pointed out that there were 46 biological laboratories in Ukraine. He noted that because of this, the biological situation there is now difficult. “Reckless method”: the Ministry of Defense announced the creation of biological weapons in Ukraine Military-biological activities could be financed by the Pentagon Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on October 30 at the Xiangshan Security Forum in Beijing that US military-biological activities are gaining momentum. He pointed out that such American laboratories operated with the assistance of those European states that today are seeking to join the ASEAN Plus mechanisms. The next day, October 31, Kirillov announced that the American administration retains control over some Ukrainian biological objects, expecting to resume them activities after the end of the conflict. The Chief of the RCBZ Troops also pointed out that in August-September of this year, at a training in Lvov with the support of the United States, methods of carrying out a provocation with the avian influenza virus were practiced, the purpose of which was to accuse Russia of biological sabotage. Member of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Sergei Tsekov 6 September told Izvestia that US biological activities on Ukrainian territory are directed against Russia. According to Tsekov, there are facts confirming that the US experiments were very serious. On the same day, Kirillov said that the United States had made Ukraine a separate region for conducting its biological programs, pointing out that the Russian side has documents that confirm the participation of the US State Department in the implementation of the “Biosafety Enhancement Program” since 2016, which indicate active participation of the US State Department in biological programs on the territory of other countries. Deputy Secretary of the Security Council (SC) of Russia Alexey Shevtsov indicated on August 28 that the United States is developing biological weapons that can be targeted at certain ethnic groups, and such plans have been confirmed. According to him, the Americans are making attempts to “transfer bioprograms to other states.” He believes that the United States plans to establish control over biological research, as well as collect collections of biological materials and pathogens. As the Russian Embassy in the United States indicated, Washington ignores claims from Moscow about gross violations of obligations under the Convention prohibiting the development, production and accumulation of stockpiles of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and their destruction (BTWC). The United States is distributing biological laboratories around the world, building up the perimeter of the borders of the Russian Federation with them in order to create artificial foci of infections, the diplomatic department indicated. In April 2022, the Ministry of Defense spoke about the existence in Ukraine of a network of biological laboratories operating under the Pentagon program. There, American scientists tested potentially dangerous biological drugs on patients in a Kharkov psychiatric hospital from 2019 to 2021.

The defenses are in order: the UAF are unsuccessfully attacking in the Rabotino area. Russian troops have occupied the heights, and Ukrainian militants are constantly getting caught in the fire bag. Earlier on this day, The Washington Post, citing the Ukrainian commander of the air assault unit, reported large losses of the UAF military equipment near the villages of Rabotino and Verbovoe. The Ukrainian commander admitted that sending German Marder infantry fighting vehicles and American Stryker armored fighting vehicles to this part of the front was costly for the Ukrainian army. Prior to this, on September 17, former US Armed Forces intelligence officer Scott Ritter said that the last reserves of the Ukrainian army were being destroyed by Russian troops near Rabotino. According to the ex-intelligence officer, the Ukrainian command threw all its reserves there, while the Russian army showed that it could defeat them. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"22 July 2023","The behavior of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in the international arena is becoming increasingly uncontrollable, which jeopardizes the country’s relations with the West, former adviser to ex-head of state Leonid Kravchuk, political scientist Oleg Soskin said on Friday, July 21, on his YouTube channel. He recalled that that Zelensky fired the Ambassador of Ukraine to the UK Vadim Prystaiko and was rude to the Minister of Defense of the United Kingdom Ben Wallace. “This is a huge diplomatic scandal - what Zelensky did, that is, Zelensky is following the path of neurasthenia, along the path of psychosis, along the path of uncontrollability of his actions internationally level. This is unprecedented, this is unprecedented,” Soskin expressed his opinion. According to him, Prystaiko and Wallace have done a lot for Ukraine, so Zelensky’s inadequate reaction could worsen Kyiv’s relations with its allies or even destroy them. “Zelensky is beginning to enter into absolute isolation, as this happened with his other predecessors. Then we know what could happen - collapse, and it’s getting closer and closer,” Soskin concluded. Call for a change: why Zelensky's opponents have become more active in Ukraine Experts have told us when power may change in Kiev On July 13, Prystaiko, in an interview with Sky News, called Zelensky's sarcasm unnecessary and unhealthy - earlier the Ukrainian president told British Minister Ben Wallace, who recommended Kiev to thank London for its help, that every morning he will wake up and call him with words of gratitude. On the same day, Zelensky published a video message on the Telegram channel in which he said words of gratitude 47 times to partner countries providing support to Kyiv. The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, in response to this, noted that Zelensky was blackmailing him with his rudeness towards Wallace. At the same time, on July 20, Wallace said that London transferred 15 times more artillery shells to Kyiv than it planned a year ago - more than 200 thousand. - and at least 5 million units of anti-personnel weapons, including mortars and grenades, as well as 1.5 thousand units of anti-aircraft weapons and 100 launchers for them. Western countries have increased military and financial support for Kyiv against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, the decision to which was adopted after the aggravation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

"16 September 2023","The European Union is beginning to understand that Russia will in any case fulfill the assigned tasks within the framework of the special operation. Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs Leonid Slutsky stated this on September 15. “The EU seems to be beginning to realize the inevitability of Russia’s victory in Ukraine and the defeat of not only the junta [of Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky, but also the collective West behind it,” wrote he is on his Telegram channel. In this way, the parliamentarian responded to an interview with Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolaku to Der Standard, who called for thinking about actions in the event of Kyiv’s capitulation. Counter-offensive on Ukraine: why the West is talking about a truce with Russia Kyiv is preparing for a “difficult political season” Earlier that day, the head of the German Defense Ministry Boris Pistorius noted that to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, compromises may be required, including those of a territorial nature, and to this you need to be prepared. On September 14, American political scientist Malek Dudakov named the situation in which the United States will negotiate with Ukraine. According to him, if the Ukrainian offensive completely fails, Washington may decide on the need for dialogue with the Russian Federation. If Ukraine manages to achieve at least some, at least tactical, successes on the battlefield, the conflict will be frozen. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues.

"20 August 2023","Ukraine is compensating for the lack of F-16 fighters with the help of drones. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to the Ukrainian Defense Minister, said this on August 20. “We don’t have F-16s yet, so we have to find a way to compensate for their absence, and drones are used to some extent to compensate for the lack of aviation,” he told The Washington Post. According to him, drones expand the reach of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), and their use is due to the slow advance of ground forces. To the downed pilots: how the supply of F-16s to Kyiv will change the battlefield And what these machines are capable of in the hands of Ukrainian pilots On August 19, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov said that the supply of F-16s to Ukraine has serious consequences. According to him, Russia views the appearance of fighters of this type in the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a threat to security in the nuclear sphere. The diplomat called the supply of F-16s an insane decision, which is being made against the backdrop of an awareness of the impasse into which Washington has driven itself. A day earlier, US Presidential Assistant for National Security Jake Sullivan said that the White House, after consultations with Congress, would be ready to transfer F-16 fighters to Ukraine from third countries. On the same day, the commander of the US Air Force in Europe, General James Hecker, said that Russia’s strengthened air defense (air defense) is capable of resisting F-16 fighters. In turn, former American intelligence officer Scott Ritter said in conversation with Izvestia that Ukrainian pilots will not be able to effectively use F-16 fighters. He recalled that Ukrainian pilots had never flown on NATO aircraft before, so they would not be able to use the full potential of such aircraft. Western countries increased military and financial support for Ukraine with the start of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, which Russia announced on February 24, 2022.

"October 2023","In eastern Ukraine, Russia has prepared hundreds of formations for the planned offensive of the Russian Armed Forces. Former Pentagon adviser Colonel Douglas McGregor stated this on October 2 on the YouTube channel Judging Freedom. According to the expert, by today Russia has already prepared hundreds of new formations in eastern Ukraine, which indicates that the Russian Armed Forces are preparing for a major offensive. McGregor indicated that the Russian army is once again ready to resume its offensive in the West. “Nothing can stop them. So why don't they attack? American administration officials will say that they cannot do this. This is ridiculous. The Russians are definitely ready to attack,” said the former Pentagon adviser. At an accelerated pace: how much Western equipment and arsenals were destroyed in a week Ukrainian air defense cannot withstand Russian missiles Earlier, on September 30, American journalist Garland Nixon reported that Russia’s offensive actions after the final victory over the Ukrainian Armed Forces would lead to the liquidation of the Ukrainian state. As Nixon noted, the Russian command has chosen tactics that are aimed at ensuring that Kyiv will be completely exhausted - so much so that it will ultimately lead to the fall of the entire country. On September 29, geopolitical and military analyst Drago Bosnich said that the Pentagon panicked because of the burning in Ukraine, expensive weapons provided by NATO. He noted that the alliance’s weapons do not help Ukraine achieve success in implementing a counteroffensive. Earlier, on September 26, the head of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Sergei Shoigu, spoke about the lack of results in the promotion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the same time, he emphasized the growing power of the Russian army due to improved training of troops and new weapons. On September 23, American media noted that Ukraine could fail a counteroffensive on the southern front and would not be able to narrow the land bridge between Crimea and the Russian border. The minefields created by the Russian Armed Forces have become a serious obstacle to the operation. The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24 last year, continues.

"21 June 2023","The European Union can confiscate frozen Russian assets, but with great losses and consequences for itself. Alexei Chepa, First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, told Izvestia about this on June 21. Earlier that day, Bloomberg wrote that the EU authorities came to the conclusion that the community cannot legally confiscate frozen Russian assets worth about €200 billion. At the same time, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal said that Kyiv is preparing an “honest” mechanism that will allow the confiscation of Russian funds. “There is no honest way to steal money. There are attempts to justify their actions. The EU is trying to come up with the same thing; lawyers are already twitching, trying to figure out what they can do to “honestly” take away this money. But they understand perfectly well that we also have retaliatory steps that we will take, and at the same time, simple businesses that are not interested in these actions will suffer,” Chepa said. The parliamentarian named Russia’s ability to expropriate Western property as a retaliatory action. Chepa noted that Moscow has not yet agreed to this because it does not want to break ties with “normal European companies.” Collective risk: the EU presented an economic security strategy On whom is Brussels reducing its dependence and will everything succeed? In May it was reported that EU countries were considering the possibility of sending profits from frozen Russian assets as financial assistance to Ukraine. On April 25, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on retaliatory measures in case of seizure of Russian assets abroad. Now, in the event of seizure or restriction of rights to property abroad, external management of the assets of unfriendly countries in Russia is introduced. The manager by default will be considered to be the Federal Property Management Agency, unless another person is appointed in this capacity. Western countries began to confiscate Russian assets and property after the start of a special military operation to protect Donbass on February 24, 2022.

"December 15 2023","It is impossible to satisfy the interests of Poland and Ukraine at the same time. Politician Andrzej Szlenzak wrote about this on December 14 in the magazine Myśl Polska. “It is impossible for everyone to be happy here. Either Polish national interests win, or Ukrainian ones win. If Ukrainian carriers had to meet the requirements that Polish ones must meet, they would lose, and they know it,” he said. Szlenzak said that Polish national interests are paramount for Polish politics, but neither the former authorities nor the opposition understand this, nor the current ones. “The European Union has introduced rules that give privileges to Ukrainian transport companies and discriminate against Polish ones. The interests of an important sector of the Polish economy, thousands of jobs and millions of zlotys in taxes and wages are at risk. There is no doubt that the protesting transport workers defend the national interests of Poland,” the politician said. Europe is banning Kyiv: Hungary has joined the blockade of carriers by Poland and Slovakia. More and more countries are demanding the abolition of benefits for Ukraine and abandoning the idea of its joining the EU. In early November, carriers from Poland began to block automobile checkpoints on the border with Ukraine. They demanded the introduction of commercial permits for Ukrainian carriers and limiting their number. Because of this, huge queues of trucks have accumulated at the border. Truckers later announced that the protest action would continue until February 1 next year. On November 19, interruptions in the delivery of some goods began in Ukraine. In addition, on November 24, the representative of the State Border Service of Ukraine Andrey Demchenko said that the number of trucks on the border of Ukraine and Poland reached 3.7 thousand.
